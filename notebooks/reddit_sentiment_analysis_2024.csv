1gmr5g8,What will be the most likely future swing states in future elections down the line?,2024-11-08 14:42:12,4,17,"As the election has settled and the final calls are being made, it's pretty obvious that Trump had an extremely dominant performance in all of the swing states. Ironically, the democrats themselves had a few victories of their own in the senate and governer races in MI, WI, NV, and NC due to the high level of split ticket voting. 

The real question however is that what states are likely to be the future swing states in future?

For reference:

The Rust Belt States of MI, WI, and PA were all within 2% margins of victory with Wisconsin being the closest

Georgia surprisingly wasn't too far off at around a 2.2% margin of victory. A far cry from Biden's performance but far less than his margin of victory against Hilary

North Carolina was at a margin of 3.4%

And while Arizona has yet to be called and fully counted, this state is showing to be the least swingiest state of all as Trump is leading by 6% points (which for reference is high than the margin for New Jersey and Virginia which were D +5 and supposed to be safe blue states)

The once competitive states of Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, and Florida have all been won by double digits and imply a big political realignment

With these states in mind, what does the outlook look for future swing states? Will it be the same seven or will other states like New Jersey, New Hampshire and Minnesota join the crew?

1gmw1a4,What will be the impacts of Trump's tariff policy during his second term?,2024-11-08 18:16:18,39,71,"Trump, who has long been supportive of using tariffs as a means of trade policy, has proposed among other things a[ flat tariff of around 10% on imports on other countries, as well as a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. In particular](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/tariffs-donald-trump-strategy/index.html), Trump has stated that these tariffs will also provide revenue in order to offset the costs of what will likely be another massive round of tax cuts.

Economists have warned that if these tariffs were to be implemented, it would cause a significant inflationary shock as company supply chains are disrupted and are forced to hike prices on certain goods in order to maintain profit margins. Given how Trump was elected off of a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment over inflation, a policy like this may end up eroding whatever goodwill and support he gained from voters hoping his presidency would resolve it. Not to mention the inevitable trade wars as countries impose tariffs of their own, hurting American manufacturers.

Some have argued that Trump's proposed tariffs are merely a pre-negotiation ploy that can be negotiated down to more reasonable levels when trade talks with China, the EU and others resume. Others think that Trump will inevitably balk or be convinced not to overreach in order to avoid alienating voters with sudden sticker shock. But given how the moderating voices of Trump's first term are gone and Trump's own mercantilist views towards trade, its also just as possible Trump will proceed with his tariff plan as intended, perhaps hoping to deflect the backlash and claim it was the fault of certain countries and companies for not complying. 

In short, what do you suppose will be the economic and political of Trump's tariff policy will be? Will they go as far as stated, or perhaps be negotiated to a more moderate level?",PoliticalDiscussion,0.0,2024-11-08,impacts trump's tariff policy second term?

",2024-11-08 10:40:19,368,708,"We live in a divided country and the republicans and democrats have wildly different visions for the future. Some of those decisions are very personal. 

Of course Trump won the election. And Trump has the backing of SCOTUS, which gave him absolute immunity as president. It’s also very likely that Republicans will have control over all three branches of government - all of Congress (senate and house), presidency and SCOTUS. Even if some of the lower courts argue and can’t decide over issues, it will go up to the Trump-friendly SCOTUS. 

What happens then if Trump and the Republicans, realizing how much power they have, act boldly and pass federal laws forcing all states to follow new controversial laws, that affect people personally. For example, abortion. 

I would imagine it would play out in the courts until it makes its way to SCOTUS. Usually this particular SCOTUS always sides with state autonomy, when issues between federal and state are presented before them. But they also have been known to not follow precedent, even their own when it suits them. 

So what happens if SCOTUS rules with the Republican majority and instructs all states to follow new federal abortion laws, for example. And what happens if blue states, like New York, refuse to follow these new federal laws or abide by SCOTUS ruling? 

Does Trump send the military to New York? Arrest Gov Hochul and NY AG James? Does New York send its own forces to protect its NY Gov and AG?

The article highlights the lowered standards of political leadership, increasing pressure to conform to groupthink, and the weakening of democratic institutions due to factors such as rising populism and a move towards a post-truth era. There have been many recent signs that the forces of populism and post-truth are only gaining strength, presenting serious danger to the future of liberal democracy in America and throughout the world. 

Democracy has produced historical prosperity and societal progress. What is the catalyst behind this accelerating rejection of democratic institutions? Is it simply that citizens have grown complacent or are there more concrete factors? And what, if anything, can be done to reverse this troubling direction?

Edit: I think some of the responses may be misinterpreting *[liberal democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy)* in this post as *[social liberalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism)*.

One of his campaign promises is to start ""the largest deportation in history"" once he takes office. I have so many questions about how he will be able to do this.

As of 2024, the US currently has 21,000 ICE officers employed throughout the country. How will a staff of this size be able to sweep the country for 10 million migrants? Will they need assistance from the military or national guard and how will they be able to train them to do this? Also, how will they be able to develop the infrastructure for detention of all these migrants? Will they be building camps or using existing prison infrastructure that is already at capacity?

If Trump is able to get the manpower and resources to do this, it is very unlikely that Mexico and other Latin American countries will just willingly take these people back in. I can see this developing into a large scale humanitarian crisis. What is Trump's plan for this? Long term detention of migrants in camps? Granting them asylum or temporary visas? Dumping them across the border covertly? Forcing Mexico to accept them?

If the migrants are all gone, who takes the place in society to do the jobs that they do? Does Trump believe that American citizens will be lining up to pick fruit in 100 degree weather for minimum wage? Who will clean hotels, work low level construction labor jobs, pick fruit, etc.?

Walz differs from Kamala Harris in a lot of ways; he's a populist (albeit a very moderate one compared to Trump), and he has an energy that a lot of people seemed to resonate with, including otherwise politically apathetic voters. Historically, he's been more progressive on issues than Kamala's campaign reflected her to be. His favorability is still high, and he's still popular in Minnesota as governor. I've seen relatively few people criticize Kamala Harris's choice of him as running mate, even in retrospect.

That said, as a candidate on the ticket, he did lose the presidential election in what's probably the greatest upset of the last 50 years, including losing his home county. There's also been criticism of his willingness to moderate his stances and policies, as well as his disposition at large, for the sake of the Kamala Harris campaign. Finally, his debate performance and ability to debate at large has largely been accepted as poor after the VP debate in October, despite people warming up to it slightly since then.

**1. President:** Could she run for president again in 2028?

**2. Senator:** Could she become a senator again? Her seat has since been filled by Sen. Alex Padilla (D). Is it a matter of courtesy that when a member of Congress gives up their seat to join the President's Cabinet, they won't return to challenge the person who filled their seat (if that person is of the same party)?

**3. Attorney General:** Would she want to become AG of California again? And even if she wanted to, could she?

**4. Other:** According to TIME magazine, unsuccessful Presidential candidates in the past have continued their political careers as governors, senators, ambassadors, judges, and Cabinet members.

1gkis5y,"Why are other federations relatively receptive to amending their constitutions, even when they need ratification by subnational governments, when the US and Canada are so incapable of amending theirs?",2024-11-05 17:07:45,34,42,"In Canada, amendments to the constitution take a few forms. The standard is 2/3 of the provinces which cumulatively have a majority of the population, their legislatures ratify an amendment which is also passed by the House of Commons. A few amendments need consent from all the legislatures and the House of Commons, and a few things particular to specific provinces like getting rid of a requirement to operate a ferry only needed that particular province's consent and the consent of the House of Commons. 1 amendment exactly has been passed by the first rule, one about Indigenous rights in 1983, and that's it. 0 have been ratified unanimously, and a few minor things about name changes and really technical things involved the last formula.

America's constitutional amendments need proposal from either a convention called on demand of 2/3 of the state legislatures or proposed by 2/3 of each house of congress, then ratification by 3/4 of the states by their legislatures or conventions held for the purpose of considering ratification. The last time this happened was in 1992, and that was with an amendment proposed 200 years ago, the last time an amendment was even proposed to the states was in the 1970s for 18-20 year olds to be able to vote following the Vietnam War.

India has a similar rule to Canada. 2/3 of both houses of the Indian Parliament agree to the proposed amendment, then a majority of state legislatures ratify it. Mexico has basically the same rule. India has had over 100 amendments since 1947, Mexico 250, with an amendment in each case often a couple of times per year, maybe a couple of years between amendments at times of low activity. Argentina and Brazil are also federations, and they have amended their constitutions in significant ways, much more so in Brazil, despite the supermajorities needed in vastly divided societies, although in those cases the subnational governments don't have to ratify them. Germany needs 2/3 of the Bundestag to agree, and 2/3 of the state cabinets have to agree by a formula that weighs them, which isn't technically a senate but acts to some degree like one, and has made amendments dozens of times since 1949, usually once every few years at least.

We have seen recent cases where bipartisan efforts focused on important legislation were initiated but failed to become law when they were either blocked from reaching a vote or were voted down exclusively by the majority party in a branch of government. A high-profile recent example is the border security bill. This proposal was assembled largely and apparently with very significant effort by assigned members of a party at their own party's request, negotiated to gather bipartisan support, and then voted against by the same party that initiated it, ostensibly for political reasons.

The topic here explores how much this inability prevents the United States from effectively governing itself in the event there is not a ""sweep"" of the Presidency, the House and the Senate by the same party.

Each of these bodies, plus arguably the (unelected) court system, has its own individual powers, and some of those such as Presidential Executive Orders can have major impacts..

But is it valid to claim that for the most critical (?) requirements of long-term government on behalf of its citizens, for truly groundbreaking and profoundly wide-reaching legislated change that directly deal with major problems,

* when majorities split, a government consisting of bodies that are able to resolve bipartisan initiatives is fundamentally important;
* this ability has not been present for some time now, and
* the cost to the United States of not having such a capability is extraordinarily great, and the damage it is causing is extraordinarily high?

And now, two days before the election, I’m going to ask this subreddit one more time, with slightly different wording now that campaigning is nearly done.

Which state(s), if any, do you believe Harris/Walz will win that Biden/Harris did not win in 2020 (flip from red to blue)? I encourage you to also include your reasoning or multiple reasons why you believe so (including but not limited to: polling or a specific poll(s), fundraising numbers, crowd sizes, early voting demographics, states each candidate/campaign visits, the economy, Roe v Wade, general vibes).

A lot has happened in the past month and a half or so since I last asked this question, so any specific events too could be valid reasons for predictions.

1gicymd,Is Elon Musk blazing a trail in US politics? has there been an unelected billionaire this involved way beyond their expertise & specialty? From PACs to legally dubious lotteries to flaunting so much influence in the upcoming administration. It feels like we broke new grounds. Is Musk is an oligarch?,2024-11-02 22:27:10,211,171,"***Source***: [https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/07/trump-elon-musk-government-position-00177845](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/07/trump-elon-musk-government-position-00177845)

Former President Donald Trump’s plan to have Elon Musk lead a government efficiency commission would vault the world’s richest man to an **unprecedented role: American oligarch.**

The details of the commission and Musk’s involvement are still vague, but any formal role in government would give greater influence to the billionaire owner of Tesla, Space X, satellite company Starlink and the social media platform X — signature ventures that have benefited from federal contracts, tax credits and government incentives.

“This is like red lights blaring, all kinds of conflicts of interest,” said Danielle Brian, president of the Project on Government Oversight.

Beyond the possible competing interests, Musk’s potential foray into government would represent a striking development for the tech titan, who would essentially have a role at the highest levels of business, manufacturing, media and Washington.

At the same time, handing Musk a position in his potential administration would fit neatly into Trump’s approach to government. The former president tapped billionaires Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin to serve in his Cabinet, though they had far lower public personas as Musk — and less to gain directly from their involvement.

Musk firmly planting himself into politics is not surprising to those who have watched him move from electric car innovator to space entrepreneur to owner of X (and online troll of liberals). But tech experts say Washington may be tricky terrain for a Silicon Valley businessperson unaccustomed to the complexities of federal bureaucracy.

Musk has described himself in the past as a moderate but shifted his allegiance to Trump, formally endorsing him after the attempted assassination in July.

So the virus was already predicted to affect the US seriously enough to give the public an experimental mRNA vaccine, but not to appropriately warn the US public for 2 more months?",2024-11-02 20:31:53,0,19,"The date of January 13, 2020 (when President Trump partnered with Moderna for vaccine development) is specified in tweets from two different direct sources [here](https://x.com/IvankaTrump/status/1328324970854948866) and [here](https://x.com/Mike_Pence/status/1328349116414439430?s=20), and is also substantiated by a SEC.gov [webpage](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000119312520074867/d884510dex991.htm).

**Brief timeline of events and statements in early 2020:**

On January 20, the [first U.S. case](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191) of the virus was confirmed.

On January 22, President Trump says the virus is “totally under control” and there are [no worries of a pandemic](https://x.com/politico/status/1220013527450247169) (nine days after he partnered with Moderna to create an experimental mRNA vaccine for the virus).

In early February, many countries including the US imposed [China travel restrictions](https://fortune.com/2020/02/06/countries-china-travel-restrictions-coronavirus/), but the WHO inexplicably claimed such restrictions were [“not needed” to beat the virus](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/who-chief-says-widespread-travel-bans-not-needed-to-beat-china-virus-idUSKBN1ZX1H3/).

On February 24, President Trump [tweets](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339) “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.”

On March 9, [Dr. Fauci says](https://globalnews.ca/video/6653403/covid-19-no-reason-not-to-go-on-cruise-if-youre-young-and-healthy-fauci) ""if you want to go on a cruise ship, go on a cruise ship"" if you're healthy and young.

On March 10, President Trump [says](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007026448/trump-coronavirus.html) “Just stay calm. It will go away.”

On March 13, (**exactly two months after he partnered with Moderna for vaccine development**), President Trump [declares a national emergency](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/13/national-emergency-coronavirus/) for the coronavirus.

Less than a month later, in April 2020, the US reaches the highest [death toll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSn3jLlk2_c) in the world. By January 2021, the reported US [death toll](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2021/01/20/despite-400000-fatalities-trump-downplayed-the-deadliness-of-covid-through-his-final-days-in-office/) was over 400,000 which represented one of the [worst rates](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/10/us-coronavirus-response-donald-trump-health-policy) among comparable countries. It would be completely wrong to place the blame solely on President Trump, since others such as Dr. Fauci and the WHO clearly made very detrimental statements at critical times as well, which are often overlooked. And in fact, contrary to common beliefs, President Biden [didn't do any better](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/12/13/biden-trump-covid-deaths/) with the death toll in a given length of time than President Trump did, and that same trend of similar or even higher deaths in 2021 and/or 2022 compared to 2020 can be seen in [mortality data around the world](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-excess-deaths-per-million-covid?tab=chart&time=2020-01-25..2022-12-31&facet=none&country=AUS~CAN~USA~JPN~GBR~DEU~ITA~KOR~FRA), which undeniably is related to the highly questionable effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines at [saving lives overall](https://heartland.org/opinion/the-most-objective-evidence-shows-no-indication-that-covid-vaccines-save-more-lives-than-they-take/), although that’s a different and highly controversial topic.

But going back to the beginning, President Trump’s decisions to take (or not take) certain actions in those critical two months from January 2020 to March 2020 played an indisputable role in sealing the nation’s fate of excess deaths and despair for the next 2+ years. So a burning question is: what exactly did President Trump know by early January 2020 which prompted him to give the green light for Moderna+NIH to develop an experimental mRNA vaccine intended for the US public to eventually take, while at the same time acting like nothing of importance to the US public was really going on for two more months until mid-March 2020, at which point a large number of deaths became essentially inevitable?",PoliticalDiscussion,0.17142857142857143,2024-11-02,"trump initiate mrna vaccine development early january 13, 2020, us virus cases identified yet? virus already predicted affect us seriously enough give public experimental mrna vaccine, appropriately warn us public 2 months?"
1gibo7v,What is Trump’s secret plan with Mike Johnson?,2024-11-02 21:18:13,358,193,"Trump recently said at a rally that he had a little secret with Mike Johnson and hinted that it would really changes things. From an article I read in The Nation (article link below) there could be a plan where battle ground states that flip for Harris that also have republican lead legislatures, would try to refuse to certify their own states electoral votes. 

The plan would be that then Mike Johnson  would say those electoral votes don’t count because they have not been certified and the total electoral count then is no longer 270 out of 538 but some lower number that presumably Trump would be able to achieve. 

This is how they would get around losing power to affect the election when/if the house flips on Jan 3rd.

Has anyone else read about this and if so what are the odds they try it? Currently it seems like that think that have it in the bag despite it being a toss up.

1gi79lt,Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges that Trump killed the biggest border security bill in decades so he could campaign on the issue instead. What will this mean for the election?,2024-11-02 17:44:41,1516,297,"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it.

1gi5cea,What effects would legally tying salaries to local cost-of-living (specifically rent) have?,2024-11-02 16:16:08,5,25,"Hello everyone! First time posing a question, so I hope I'm doing this right. If this is too speculative, i apologize. Anyway, I'm someone on the cusp of the millenial/Gen Z divide, and it seems like my entire adult life (and even years before) the increased cost of living, especially where housing is concerned, and wages that have (mostly) not kept pace with those costs has loomed over my generation's head. Even people I know who make good money with engineering degrees can't technically qualify for an apartment on their own because they don't make 3x the rent in some areas.

Obviously the affordable housing crisis is a complex issue that's affected by global and local factors, and there is no one solution to addressing it, but it seems like in most places in America there is little to no real appetite politically to address it at all. I was wondering how fast that might change if (and I realise this is a big if, but entertain me on this hypothetical please) a federal law was passed that required compensation to be tied to the average cost of a rental unit in a given area.

Let's assume this law would affect companies who have 75+ employees, and let's assume the law specifies the lowest paid full-time employee must receive 3x the average cost of rent in the surrounding area. The surrounding area is defined as someplace within an hour's commute of the workplace.

What economic effects would you predict from something like this, particularly in more populated and expensive areas? Would it result more in businesses implementing evasive tactics (this could range from actually encouraging work from home to making more positions part-time to get out of the requirement and save money)? Would the burden be too much and encourage businesses to leave to potentially cheaper areas, hurting the former area but creating new economic opportunities for others?

My biggest question is, if businesses were made to more directly feel the consequences of high residential housing costs in expensive areas, would there suddenly be more of an appetite to rein in greedy corporate rental practices and inflationary housing assessment? Would the construction of affordable housing units become a bigger priority?

And an even bigger question: do you think something like this would cause more harm than good?",PoliticalDiscussion,0.1,2024-11-02,effects would legally tying salaries local cost-of-living (specifically rent) have?

He asked me this question: ""If Trump is an existential threat, as is often said, would the current president send him to some off the books site or something to make sure he doesn't harm the country as his oath says he must?""

I said that America doesn't do that. They have elections and if people aren't happy with the outcome they vote differently in the next election. Just like in Australia.  

So his next question is: What if somehow Bin Laden met all the qualifications. He was secretly birthed there, faked his death, and has been living in America for 15 years. He's changed his name, no beard, one wife, no kids that he claims - whatever it takes to make it plausible. He runs for president on a populist platform and becomes popular enough to get 50% in polls. But finally it comes out that he is provably the real Bin Laden. His support doesn't drop.

Obama had a petition system on the White House website where a petition could get signed and would cause the president, or more likely, his staff wrote a response which the president signed off on, to write a response, once it reached a quorum of 100,000 signatories. Britain has a petitions system on their website with 10,000 signatories causing a response from the executive cabinet, 100,000 would trigger a debate in Parliament (House of Commons). I imagine a threshold could be engineered where a committee of parliament would be required to write a report and hold a hearing pertaining to it. Legislation can even be initiated in some countries via a petition, forcing a vote in the legislature on whether or not to agree with it and putting a public record of that, and the possibility of enactment being on the table.

Petitions of a certain size can in many places trigger a vote in some way, in Italy, 500,000 signatories in a country with roughly 50 million voters, or about 1%, can demand that a ballot question be put to the electorate related to legislation which was recently passed, and if a majority of voters turn out and the majority of valid votes are against the legislation, the legislation is defeated and repealed.

These unions sought better pay, working conditions, leave policies, and much more. They threatened, and at times did, respond with crippling strikes to some of the US' largest companies. And for good reason--this country prides on its blue collar workers and with so many electoral votes up for grabs in rust belt states, it makes sense that national politicians play a key role in mediating these discussions. Historically, these jobs paid good wages and provided great benefits as a result of these unions which is a token of immense pride. Lately, successes in these unions have spurred numerous other strikes to spread to other industries like aviation, shipping, and even at Netflix.

1gfn2qa,Which party do you think will come in third for president in New York: the WFP or the Conservatives?,2024-10-30 09:54:16,14,15,"New York employs a system of voting known as disaggregated electoral fusion. Each party on the ballot is free to nominate whoever they want, even if another party has also nominated that candidate, which can lead to the same candidate appearing multiple times under different parties. You then vote a party for an office, and then the parties with the same candidate pool their votes together.

One effect of this is a history of small parties that traditionally cross endorse major party candidates, the two most significant of which are the Conservative Party and the Working Families Party (often called the WFP), who this year have nominated Trump and Harris respectively, as to be expected.

Now typically the Conservatives have performed noticeably better than any other third party in the state, including the WFP, but back in 2020 there was a large push from progressive democrats for people to vote on the WFP line, due to fears that their ballot status was in danger due to changes in the threshold for ballot status created by allies of Andrew Cuomo, who long quarreled with the WFP. As a result of this push, the WFP performed the best in its history, receiving 386,000 votes and outperforming the Conservatives for the first time ever in a statewide race. However, the Conservatives returned to the third place slot in the 2022 gubernatorial race, as Hochul underperformed overall (although the WFP still improved on their 2018 performance).

""for me is is very simple: Donald Trump was a better president than Kamala Harris would be; with all Donald Trump's flaws, with all of his excesses and **because we do have a very robust and durable constitutional system, almost built to hem in his flaws and excesses, what that means is that I get a lot of good policy that I wouldn't get with Kamala Harris**.""

(this is from 11:40 to 12:30, taken from youtube's transcript)

Shapiro's point is that, even though Trump was a president with ""a rhetoric he often didn't like"" (at 11:14), and who is prone to excesses, what he calls a robust and durable constitutional system will be fully capable of taking in and filtering out such excesses; and that because of such constitutional system, Trump will be a better president, even if he is not necessarily the best candidate personally. This claim has  been corroborated frequently in this election cycle, by right wing pundits, as talking points by the media, etc. 

This is quite a strong claim to make, nonetheless. Should we judge *any* given candidate's capacity to serve *in light* of the American constitutional system? While different people may hold different views on how to evaluate a candidate, can we say *objectively* that the US's constitutional system is indeed capable of ruling out excesses effectively every time? Or is it flawed and not immune to being played? If so, what possible changes could be made?

In his time as a Republican president and his numerous races as the Republican candidate, Trump has drawn enormous support and loyalty from a subset of Americans that were not your traditional Republicans and were likely not as politically active or even interested prior to Trump.

Not only does Trump’s stances, rhetoric, style, etc. differ dramatically from traditional party candidates, but a significant portion of his voter base are markedly more loyal to him than his party in general, meaning when he exits, the Republican Party will likely not be able to depend on these voters.

Additionally, Trump’s divisive nature has caused a discernible rift within the party, where more establishment-type politicians with much deeper roots in the party show a disdain for Trump and his supporters—Romney, the Cheney’s, Pence, Bush, Christie.

1gdeysf,Will there be a peaceful transition of power if Trump wins the election?,2024-10-27 12:32:17,0,57,"Given Trump's behavior and past actions, there have been multiple posts on this subreddit about the risk of him attempting to overturn the election should he lose. With Harris and Trump neck and neck in current polling, the presidential election could easily go either way. If it happened to go in Trump's favor, would there be a peaceful transition of power? 

  
In everything from major news networks to this subreddit, commentary on Trump's threat to democracy has grown exponentially in the last few weeks. Added onto the commentary on his threat is a plethora of articles, posts, and videos about him being a fascist, what's wrong with the people voting for him, etc. Given how widespread these topics have become on social media, it can be assumed that many Harris voters believe these things to be true to some degree. With so many people believing Trump is a danger to democracy, their own freedom, etc. how probable is it that these people would prevent a peaceful transition of power?

  
A recent [NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/politics/american-democracy-poll.html?smid=url-share) fueled this train of thought. The article is about people's views on the ""health"" of democracy. A few important statistics from the article, 47% of people polled were concerned that Trump may overturn the election while 33% of people were concerned Harris would overturn the election. Another statistic showed that Harris voters were more likely to describe Trump voters as the enemy than vice versa(16% vs 11%).

* Last week's poll was significant because Muslims voters have overwhelmingly backed democrats for the last two decades by margins of 60-70%.  

Donald Trump's rally today in Novo, Michigan marked a **Major shift.** Trump openly invited Muslims leaders to speak and discuss how they seek peace in the middle east.

* Trump attacked **Liz and Dick Cheney** for their support for the Iraq war and called the Cheney's ""Arab hating"" and ""Muslim hating""
   * He said ""Kamala is campaigning with Muslim-hating Liz Cheney. Whose father brought years of war and death to the middle east""
* Trump highlighted that Muslim voters have come to him and are simply asking for peace in the region
* He acknowledged that their **votes could turn the election**, implying he knows how important the voting block is.
* The **NYT** reported that Mr. Trump has made more public overtures to voters, including two interviews with Arab media outlets last week. This has also been followed by increase advertising targeting arab voters in the Detroit suburbs

  
Trump has a long history of making Islamophobic comments, but as we have seen with polls this year, his increased support among minority groups, his comment may not be as influential as people thing.

That undercuts both issues as an explanation for this election's (alleged) shifts in voting patterns.

Rather it's a convincing win in the electoral college one way or the other. Since most of the talk of Reddit has been how Trump will/should lose due to the left-lean of Redditors, but not the voting public at large, how surprised would you be if Trump won comfortably?

The definition of a blowout win in modern times is Obama's 2008 victory. For Trump such a win probably wouldn't occur, but he could sweep all the swing states plus New Hampshire and Minnesota if his victory is large enough. That would get him to 326 electoral votes to 212 for Harris.

In such a scenario, the Republicans would most likely keep the House and take the Senate with upset victories in the Senate races of MI, WI, OH, and PA along with MT and WV which would result in a 55-45 GOP Senate.

While Democrats could still block legislation in the Senate through the filibuster, if Republicans decided to get rid of it, they would be able to pass whatever legislation that wanted, further cementing Republican rule.

1gas6fj,Joe Walsh’s Political Reckoning: How Do We View Public Figures Who Admit They Were Wrong?,2024-10-23 22:24:57,80,101,"Joe Walsh, former Tea Party congressman and right-wing radio host, has gone through a significant public transformation in recent years. After years of contributing to the extreme rhetoric that dominated conservative media, he’s now admitted that he was wrong and is genuinely trying to make amends for the harm he helped cause. He’s been vocal about his regret, even starting a podcast where he consistently bashes the modern Republican Party and Trump, and repeatedly beats himself down for his past aggressive support of both. It really seems like a true “come to Jesus” moment, where Walsh is fully aware of the damage he’s done and is trying to reconcile with it.

But despite this intense self-reflection, his shift has largely made him irrelevant in the political landscape. My question is: How do we view someone like Walsh, who was once so loud and influential in shaping harmful narratives but has since tried to fix what he did? Is this kind of reckoning enough? Do public figures deserve credit for trying to right their wrongs, or is it too little, too late? What impact do you think Walsh’s shift really has, if any?

It also makes me wonder—how much of this is just a universal challenge for republics and democracies?

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US

Should the federal government only consist of those elected into office?,2024-10-23 16:20:45,0,31,"In a 2023 commentary piece by Mike Gonzalez of the Heritage Foundation, he writes: 

>MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, another who is never one for nuance, said Project 2025 will “radically change the form of governance that we have in the United States so as to concentrate all the powers of the government in a single leader.” It is “fundamentally opposite to the whole idea of why we exist as a country in the first place,” she claimed.

>Perhaps Maddow was absent on the day the history teacher discussed government being “of the people, for the people, and by the people.” Nobody elected the some four million-strong federal bureaucracy.

The implication, as I understand it, in his response to Maddow’s comment is that, if one is not elected to a federal position, they should not hold a government position. Obviously, this is a drastic measure and highly improbable, but the question still remains. Should the government function without, or with as few as possible, non-elected employees or do the various roles of government often need to be handled by those officials?

1gajie1,What do you think the impact of male chauvinism in the United States will have on the Presidential election?,2024-10-23 15:47:49,0,32,"With a potential first female president, do you think some men will abstain from voting or even vote against Harris simply because she’s a woman? If so, what type of impact would you expect? 

(BING for context and clarification) 
Male chauvinism manifests differently across various cultural groups in the United States, often influenced by historical, social, and economic factors. Here are a few examples:

1. **African American Communities**: During the civil rights movement, male chauvinism was a significant issue within groups like the Black Panthers. Women in these movements often had to fight against both racial oppression and gender discrimination³.

2. **Latino Communities**: In some Latino cultures, traditional gender roles are deeply ingrained, which can perpetuate male chauvinism. However, there are also strong feminist movements within these communities that challenge these norms³.

3. **Asian American Communities**: Similar to other minority groups, Asian American women have faced male chauvinism within their communities. Activists have worked to address these issues alongside broader struggles against racism and economic exploitation³.

4. **White American Communities**: Male chauvinism in white American communities can often be linked to conservative and traditionalist values. This has been particularly evident in recent years with the rise of movements that seek to reinforce traditional gender roles⁴.

These examples highlight that while male chauvinism is a widespread issue, the specific dynamics can vary significantly across different cultural contexts. If there's a particular group or aspect you're interested in, let me know!

Some of those who have worked closely with him in the past and others who have faced the wrath of Trump believe he is quite capable of following through with his threats. Others, like Johnson \[Speaker of the House\] have dismissed his comments as jest and comical or otherwise tried to rationalize it.

He has often threatened what he has described as democrats and leftists, but also named Nancy Pelosi and Adma Schiff specifically \[among others\].

On [Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmmx1zQCQds&t=485s), Trump expressed support for using government force against domestic political rivals. Since 2022, when he began preparing for the presidential campaign, Trump has issued more than 100 threats to investigate, prosecute, imprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents, NPR has found.

A review of Trump’s rally speeches, press conferences, interviews and social media posts shows that the former president has repeatedly indicated that he would use federal law enforcement as part of a campaign to exact “[retribution](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/109967829299924979).”

Vice President Kamala Harris “should be impeached and prosecuted,” Trump [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgdVgxxELbQ&t=1590s) at a rally last month.

“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump [said](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/bFORNS0mvNOxmr9cbwwpUJRzq-pofVnRhYN3vHJKQdeiFjefDAKwDpPowHng3r_kHNX-RDMkd2KrzETglXlCPsGi_Wk?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1706.4) last year.

Journalists who decline to identify the sources of leaked information would also face imprisonment, Trump said.

When right-wing radio host Glenn Beck asked Trump if he would lock up his opponents in a second term, Trump [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lywHT5uH71M&t=124s), “The answer is you have no choice because they’re doing it to us.”

Legal experts said that there are few guardrails preventing Trump from pursuing his plans to prosecute opponents and noted that Trump pressured the Department of Justice to investigate rivals during his first term. In about a dozen cases, the Justice Department followed through and initiated investigations, according to one [analysis](https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/).

If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?

What if the government (hypothetically) started collecting and storing all plastic waste separately from other waste, in a compressed and efficient way, almost like a national “plastic stockpile”?

By keeping plastic waste isolated and stored, we could prevent it from polluting the environment (oceans, landfills, etc.) while also creating a resource that could be used once better technologies emerge to recycle or repurpose it. It would require large-scale infrastructure for storage and maintenance, but could this be a more responsible way to handle plastic waste while waiting for innovations to catch up?

During the impeachment proceedings, many Republicans believed that they couldn't impeach a person who no longer held office. This was cited by Mitch McConnell in his prominent speech blaming Trump for Jan 6th.

First it was saying he would not debate Harris again, but then he cancelled 60 Minutes, CNBC, and most recently an NRA event in Georgia. He will still do friendly events, however the trend has been sitting out events to not say something potentially harmful to his campaign. Obviously the thought process behind this is the notion that the less voters see (or more importantly *hear*) of Trump, the better he does.

However, I was curious what everyone's thoughts were on this strategy. With less than three weeks till election day, could it really help Trump to not be in front of voters in high profile media opportunities? Could not being the main focus of election coverage help Trump by pushing attention (good and bad) toward Harris, allowing Republicans to pick apart her responses while not giving Democrats the same opportunity.

In a short-term government funding extension that President Biden signed into law on Sept. 26, Congress allotted an additional $231 million to the Secret Service.

Additionally, The Enhanced Presidential Security Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law on Oct. 1, requires the Secret Service to provide the same level of security for presidential and vice presidential candidates from major parties that is provided for the incumbent president and vice president.

This comes after ​​the formation of a House task force to investigate the attempted assassination of Trump in July, and the resignation of former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle.

The Secret Service came under fire following the assassination attempts, with many questioning how such incidents could even occur in the first place. Criticism has arisen surrounding operatives’ ability to perform their duties and the effectiveness of the agency’s leaders.

Barry Donadio, who served as a Secret Service agent under the Obama and George W. Bush administrations, told Capital News Service the public should recognize the bravery and dedication to duty by the agents during the assassination attempts on Trump rather than blaming the Secret Service.

“The Secret Service, at least in my time and as far back as I know, has always been understaffed,” he said. “They are so specialized in what they do. You’ve heard them testify to this in court: it takes years to make a Secret Service agent.”

But if you think about it for a moment, what do the “national interests” actually mean? A single action can benefit some people within a nation, and harm others. For example, setting tariffs on import will benefit producers, but harm consumers, going to a war on the other side of the globe might be beneficial for arms manufacturers, not so much for the people who might be forced to go there, in case there’s conscription, etc.

So if we define “national interests” as something that, if achieved, would benefit every citizen of a given country, then I am afraid those things practically don’t exist.

If we define it as the interests of the ruling elites, then it sounds contrary to the idea of that they are supposed to mean. Besides, different people and fractions within the ruling class can have interests that conflict with each other.

Many people posted saying that they were Atheist conservatives and being Pro-Life had nothing to do with religion.

Roe V. Wade itself was passed by a heavily Republican seem court headed by Republican Chief Justice Warren E. Burger as well as Justices Harry Blackmun, Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist.

While not really Pro-Choice or Pro-Life himself to Ronald Reagan abortion was kind of a non-issue. He spent his administration with other issues.

# Bottom Line

About four weeks remain until Election Day, and some voters have already cast their ballots. Based on voters’ intentions as of late September, the bulk of voting should take place on Election Day. But as prior years’ polling has shown, many more voters will likely end up voting before Election Day than intended to do so weeks prior, and it could be the case that the majority of 2024 ballots are cast before Election Day.

While mail voting promises to be less common than it was during the 2020 pandemic, that method is still preferred much more by Democrats than Republicans. If absentee ballot processing and counting stretches beyond Election Day, particularly in larger cities with the greatest number of voters, the ballots counted later will likely contain more votes for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates, as occurred in 2020.

1g18y0x,"(New York Times) How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election.
A methodological choice has created divergent paths of polling results. Is this election more like 2020 or 2022?",2024-10-11 08:46:32,62,31,"***Source***: [*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/upshot/polling-methods-election.html) ***(Paywall)***

Over the last month, one methodological decision seems to have produced two parallel universes of political polling.

In one universe, Kamala Harris leads only narrowly in the national popular vote against Donald J. Trump, even as she holds a discernible edge in the Northern battlegrounds. The numbers look surprisingly similar to the 2022 midterm election.

In the other, Ms. Harris has a clear lead in the national vote, but the battlegrounds are very tight. It’s essentially a repeat of the 2020 election.

This divide is almost entirely explained by whether a pollster uses “weighting on recalled vote,” which means trying to account for how voters *say* they voted in the last election.

Here’s how it works. First, the pollster asks respondents whether they voted for Joe Biden or Mr. Trump in the last election. Then they use a statistical technique called weighting, in which pollsters give more or less “weight” to respondents from different demographic groups, such that each group represents its actual share of the population. In this case, the pollster weights the number of Biden ’20 or Trump ’20 voters to match the outcome of the last election.

This approach had long been considered a mistake. For reasons we’ll explain, pollsters have avoided it over the years. But they increasingly do it today, partly as a way to try to make sure they have enough Trump supporters after high-profile polling misfires in 2016 and 2020. The choice has become an important fault line among pollsters in this election, and it helps explain the whiplash that poll watchers are experiencing from day to day.

**Over the last month, about two-thirds of polls were weighted by recalled vote.**

An important — and perhaps obvious — consequence of weighting by recalled vote is that it makes poll results look more like the 2020 election results. The polls that don’t do it\*,\* including New York Times/Siena College surveys, are more likely to show clear changes from four years ago.

While the differences between the two sets of polls are relatively small, they add up to two different stories of the election. The polls that *don’t* weight on past vote tend to show results that align more closely with the result of the 2022 midterm election than the last presidential election. They also show that Mr. Trump’s advantage in the Electoral College, with respect to the popular vote, has dwindled over the last four years. The polls weighted on past vote, on the other hand, show little more than a 2020 repeat of the Electoral College gap.

As we’ll see, this is a fraught decision for pollsters. On one hand, weighting on recalled vote would have produced worse results in every presidential election from 2004 to 2020. On the other, it’s the choice that might save pollsters from underestimating Mr. Trump yet again.

**Why this kind of weighting is controversial**

When I started following polling methodology debates 20 years ago, weighting on recalled vote was considered a very bad idea. A surprising number of respondents don’t remember how they voted; they seem likelier to remember voting for the winner; and they sometimes report voting when voting records show they did not.

This pattern has persisted all the way from the first time I read about recall vote all the way to the present, based on data archived at the Roper Center and 2021-24 data from the Pew Research Center and Times/Siena. The same pattern shows up in the exit polls in every presidential election year when it was asked (2004, 2008, 2020).

The tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the last election means that weighting on recall vote has a predictable effect: It increases support for the party that lost the last election.

While polls have a lot of issues, underestimating the party that lost the last election doesn’t turn out to be one of them. As a result, weighting on recalled vote would have made the polls less accurate in every election since 2004 (the farthest back considered), based on a re-analysis of 70 polls archived at the Roper Center.

The effect of recall vote in 2020 is especially revealing: The polls that year were so poor that there are individual cases where recall-vote weighting would have helped. For example, it would have produced a smaller lead for Mr. Biden in ABC/Washington Post’s [infamous poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/28/power-up-new-post-abc-polling-shows-biden-with-big-lead-wisconsin-where-coronavirus-cases-are-rising/) showing him leading by 17 points in Wisconsin in October 2020. But it wouldn’t have fixed it, either; by our estimate, it would have still shown Mr. Biden up 12 if recall vote had been used when producing the result. And it would have made most other 2020 polls less accurate, on average, including Times/Siena polls and most of the other ABC/Post polls.

What does it mean if recall vote wouldn’t have been enough to fix the polls four years ago? The most straightforward interpretation: For the 2020 polls to be right, pollsters needed the 2016 recall vote to look “wrong.” The polls needed Mr. Trump to hold a clear lead on recall vote — exactly what one would have expected historically, given the tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the previous election.

As a result, recalled vote didn’t even help the polls in the biggest polling misfire in 40 years.

**Why pollsters now weight on recall vote**

Despite that record, many pollsters have decided to weight on recall vote for four main reasons.

First, many pollsters believe recall vote is more reliable than it used to be. Whether it’s accurate enough is another question, but it’s certainly true that recall vote looks “closer” to the last election result than in prior cycles. The last three years of Times/Siena and Pew Research NPORS data show about a three-point gap between recalled 2020 vote and the actual 2020 result, a far cry from the double-digit differences a decade or two ago.

Why could recall vote be getting more accurate? One possibility is that poll respondents have become more likely to remember whom they voted for in the last election, thanks to rising political engagement and polarization. Another possibility is that data collected online may be less vulnerable to whatever it is that causes the “winner bias” (importantly, almost all the reanalyzed polls — where we produced estimates of what a poll’s result might be if it had used recall-vote weighting — were telephone surveys).

This election also features a novel case: The loser of the last election is running again (and most Republicans don’t even believe he lost), and the winner of the last election just lost a rematch, in a sense, against that loser. It’s anyone’s guess how all of this affects the accuracy of recall vote, but it is easy to imagine further mitigation of the traditional “winner bias.”

Second, some pollsters use panels of repeat survey-takers, which means they have responses from them over a long period. A pollster may have asked panelists in 2020 how they voted, as opposed to asking them today to remember how they voted four years ago. This counts as weighting on past vote, but it’s not quite the same as someone’s recalled vote. This approach ought to be less vulnerable to the biases in recall-vote weighting, even if there are still challenges involved — like what to do about any new panelists or changes in the makeup of the electorate since 2020.

Third, recall vote can be used to bludgeon self-evidently unrepresentative data toward a more plausible result. This is especially useful for survey designs with no plausible case for validity, like a poll of people from a single social media platform. No one expects such an approach to yield a good sample, but recall-vote weighting can quickly get it into the ballpark. Indeed, more than 80 percent of opt-in online panel polls weight on recall vote, while other kinds of polls are less likely to do so.

Fourth, recall vote is being used to help address the tendency for polls to understate Mr. Trump’s strength over the last eight years.

As mentioned earlier, weighting on recall vote historically helps the candidate who lost the last election. This year, that’s Mr. Trump. You can see it for yourself in the last round of Times/Siena battleground state polls — almost all of them would have scooted to the right if they had been weighted by recall vote:

**How recent Times/Siena polls would have changed**

* Pennsylvania: Harris +4 (without recall vote) —> Trump +1 (with recall vote)
* Michigan: Harris +1 —> Trump +1
* Wisconsin: Harris +2 —> Trump +1
* North Carolina: Trump +3 —> Trump +6
* Arizona: Trump +5 —> Trump +3
* Georgia: Trump +4 —> Trump +6

Of course, the recall-vote-weighted poll results here represent an entirely plausible outcome. If the polls underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did four or eight years ago, November’s results might look exactly like this. But historically, it’s not surprising that weighting on recall vote would help Republicans: Mr. Trump lost the last election; as such, weighting on recall vote would be expected to give more weight to Trump ’20 voters, and therefore to Mr. Trump today.

When big-name traditional pollsters weight by recall vote, this is usually the reason. Some of these pollsters think it’s a perfectly valid measure, but many only use it grudgingly. They still more or less believe the old arguments against recall vote, but they choose to employ it anyway. They wouldn’t be doing it if they trusted their data to produce unbiased results, and they wouldn’t be doing it if it didn’t shift their polls toward Mr. Trump.

As Patrick Murray of the Monmouth poll put it in [explaining](https://x.com/PollsterPatrick/status/1824477952043618633) his decision to weight on recall vote, “The Trump phenomenon is sui generis, and you have to pick your poison.”

**Did recall vote fix past problems?**

There is some good news contained in this story: Recall-vote weighting is almost certainly reducing the risk that the polls systematically underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did in 2016 or 2020. As we’ve shown, it has given many pollsters a quick and easy fix to move their numbers toward the right.

Many of the worst survey results of the 2020 election seem unlikely to be repeated this time around. For instance, The Washington Post and CNN/SSRS state polls now weight by recall vote, which means we won’t be seeing any results like Biden +17 in Wisconsin or Biden +16 nationwide.

But there’s a strange contradiction between the two major observations so far — and the contradiction points toward real trade-offs involving recall-vote weighting.

On the one hand, many pollsters are weighting on recall vote because it yields more Republican-leaning results.

On the other, the polls weighted like this aren’t necessarily producing especially Republican-leaning results. They don’t look like the hypothetical recall-weighted Times/Siena polls, for instance. Instead, they’re producing results neatly in line with the result of the 2020 election.

**How is that possible? There are two basic possibilities.**

One is that the polls weighted on recall vote are full of highly engaged voters who haven’t shifted since 2020, and therefore weighting on recall vote will produce a 2020 repeat.

Another possibility: It may be employed selectively by pollsters concerned their data is too far to the left. The two theories could be connected, as highly engaged voters have leaned left during the Trump era. Weighting on recall vote, then, would move a group of relatively Democratic-leaning samples neatly in line with the 2020 election result.

Whatever the explanation, this tension suggests significant trade-offs as pollsters weight on recall vote. Most obviously, it may make it harder to identify any changes since the last election. One reason is simply because recall-vote weighting mechanically forces polls toward the last election result. But even deeper than that, the technique is being used, at least in part, because pollsters don’t trust their survey results. It’s an attitude that can lead pollsters to treat surprising and unusual data as suspicious, rather than potentially newsworthy or insightful. This is understandable: I know I don’t always trust our survey results after the last decade of polling misfires. But when legitimate concern about polling morphs into weighting away otherwise outlying findings, it risks squelching any indication of anything that might be out of the ordinary.

In a way, the problem is reminiscent of something [called “herding,”](https://aapor.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Herding-508.pdf) in which pollsters tweak their surveys to bring their results into alignment with the average of other polls. Like herding, the decision to weight on past vote is often a reflection of how pollsters feel about the quality of their underlying data. In this case, however, pollsters aren’t necessarily herding toward what other pollsters say. Instead, they’re essentially herding toward the result of the last presidential election.

A near repeat of the last presidential election is certainly a plausible outcome. In today’s polarized era, who could possibly be surprised by a repeat in Mr. Trump’s third presidential run? If it’s a near repeat, the polls weighted by recall vote won’t just have an excellent night themselves, but they might also spare the entire industry another four years of misery.

1fzw29g,Have Democrats and Republicans Made Good Faith Efforts on Immigration Reform?,2024-10-09 12:49:16,2,1,"Immigration reform has been a highly polarizing issue in U.S. politics, and each party claims to have the best approach. I'd like to initiate a civil, balanced discussion about whether either party has made good faith efforts to tackle immigration reform. Here are some specific questions I have:

1. Have Democrats Made Good Faith Efforts at Immigration Reform?

Historically, the Democratic Party has supported more progressive immigration policies. During President Biden’s administration, several measures have been proposed, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and a focus on more humanitarian asylum policies. However, critics argue that some of these policies could encourage illegal immigration. How sincere are these efforts, and have they been accompanied by realistic enforcement measures?

Example: The Biden administration proposed the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. Supporters argue this is a compassionate, necessary solution, while critics say it lacks strong border security measures.

2. Did Immigration Get Out of Hand During the Biden Administration?

My understanding is that the southern border has faced increased pressure since Biden took office. Some claim that his administration’s rollback of Trump-era policies, such as ""Remain in Mexico,"" has caused a spike in illegal border crossings. However, others argue that external factors, like violence in Central America and economic crises, are major drivers that any administration would struggle to control.

Is the surge at the border directly tied to Biden’s policies, or is this a more complex issue beyond any single administration’s control?

3. Do Democrats Have Something to Gain from Unchecked Illegal Immigration?

A common argument from critics, is that Democrats might benefit politically from increased illegal immigration, potentially gaining votes if immigrants are naturalized and able to vote in the future. Is there any credible evidence that Democrats support more lenient immigration policies for this purpose, or is this purely speculation?

4. Is There Evidence of Illegal Immigrants Voting in U.S. Elections?

Voter fraud, particularly involving non-citizens, is a frequent concern raised in immigration debates. However, research on this is mixed. Multiple studies have shown that instances of illegal immigrants voting are rare and often exaggerated, yet some Republican lawmakers continue to push for stricter voter ID laws.

Is there any significant, verifiable evidence that illegal immigrants are participating in U.S. elections in numbers large enough to influence outcomes?

5. Does Proposed Legislation Contain Unreasonable Clauses Leading to Justified Republican Opposition?

Many immigration reform bills introduced by Democrats have faced opposition from Republicans, some claiming that the provisions are simply too lenient or impractical. For instance, the Biden administration's immigration proposals include a clause requiring the processing of at least 3,000 immigrants per day at the border. Critics argue this creates an incentive for more illegal crossings and overwhelms the system.

Is this opposition justifiable? Are there elements in these bills that Republicans could reasonably argue would make border enforcement ineffective?

6. Have Republicans Made Good Faith Efforts on Immigration Reform?

Republicans typically focus more on border security and strict enforcement. During Trump’s presidency, initiatives like the border wall and family separation policies were implemented to deter illegal immigration. However, comprehensive immigration reform, which balances security with addressing the status of undocumented immigrants already in the country, did not occur under Trump or previous Republican administrations.

Do Republican proposals overly focus on enforcement at the expense of addressing the full scope of the issue? Are there credible bipartisan efforts from Republicans to find a middle ground?

7. What Are the Incentives for Both Parties to Solve or Block Solutions to Illegal Immigration?

Finally, let’s consider the political incentives for both parties. Some argue that Democrats benefit from a more lenient stance, appealing to immigrant communities, while Republicans benefit from maintaining a hardline approach to satisfy their base’s demand for strict enforcement. Both parties may also use the issue as a political weapon against each other.

Are these motivations driving a lack of real progress on immigration reform?

If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

This power is created by votes. The more votes, the more power a party holds. Therefore, the party is incentivised to get as much votes as possible. 

An easy way to get more votes is to shape public opinion and perception. This is today often done by mass media. Any political party who has even partial control of mass media is therefore in an advantaged position. An increase in media control leads to more votes, more votes lead to more power. This power can then be used to gain more control of media. 

My question is: Is this a process that will eventually lead to a merger of media and political parties? Will the end result be political parties that are also media conglomerates, or media businesses that are also political parties?

Haitian community filed a lawsuit charging Trump and Vance for inciting violence along with two other charges. The case is currently under further investigation by the Springfield prosecutors office. 

Trump has now decided to spread lies about FEMA under the Biden Harris Campaign, stating that ""Biden is restricting access to resources to conservative areas"" . Which by the own words of Republican state governments and city officials is not true giving praise to Biden and respect to FEMA for their rapid response.

 * The 2 projects went from $350 million to $177 million.

*  VDOT will buy most of the Grundy business district at “fair market value” and demolish it to make way for an 8-foot levee built by the Army Corps
 *  Twenty tracts of land were acquired.  
* VDOT will build a new 4 lane U.S. Highway 460 on top of that levee
* A new 13-acres of businesses and residences are to be built on a mountain across the river,  
 * Process called “benching,” which requires significant cuts be made in the side of the mountain to create the land. Removing 2.3 million cubic yards of soil 
* Construction of the redevelopment included railroad relocation and construction of a highway access bridge and a pedestrian
bridge. 
*  Construction of the relocated fire station and Police Station

The next step in 2021 is a $288 million addition that is moving Grundy high school, building a wall around another learning center and the voluntary floodproofing and acquisition of additional eligible properties.

Jeffrey Sachs emphatically believes that we have no business whatsoever interfering in the affairs of Russia, China, and Iran. Sachs also mentioned our failing domestic state and how we, the US government, should place more emphasis on domestic development. 

It reminded of the America First Agenda. Under an America First Agenda purportedly carried out by the Trump Administration, there were significant domestic policies implemented: tightening immigration and refugee policies, the reorganization of NAFTA, and the Tariffs were actually significant in my opinion, even from a nominal or aesthetic stance, it sent a message. However, it seemed that we still placed foreign policy at the forefront of our agenda even under an America First administration: Abraham Accords, Jerusalem Embassy, Syria and Iran Strikes, Afghan Missions. I was anticipating a rather aggressive domestic policy that significantly and positively impacted the lives of the majority of hourly-working-wage Americans, let alone improving infrastructure or access to affordable and reliable healthcare. 

Given the current geopolitical climate which the United States is directly involved in (Russia+Ukraine and Israel+Gaza+Lebanon+Iran), how can either Political Administration implement an America First / Non-Interventionist Agenda whilst supporting allies and proxies?

I am asking from the perspective of a global superpower. Is it even possible to be considered a global superpower without asserting your dominance economically and or militarily on other nations?   
  
The Brits, the Japanese, the French, the Portuguese, the Spanish, the Ottomans, the Dutch, and many other small and large political forces, in some way expanded their influence well beyond their borders to maintain some type of hegemony.  
  
I find it slightly naïve to think that aspiring large powerful nations only want to grow internally and economically without asserting some kind of dominance, whether it's soft power or hard power, it's still some form of dominance that ambitious nations pursue.   
  
Can the United States balance the effort of delivering actual substantial tangible domestic policy goals (increase in wages, access to Affordable health care, modest interest rates, first-time home ownership, college education or universal access to trade schools) while maintaining global power? Or are both parties lying to the American people and only offering at best aesthetic incremental policies that keep Americans distracted or placated for 4 years with a small temporary tax cut, tighter immigration at the border, or a small child tax credit increase, without addressing other major systemic domestic issues?

If only one of them made a move, Nato/Western countries are able to support them. But to me it seems more and more like a quite well coordinated series of attacks, furthering escalation gradually without bursting into a full blown war. Multiple stages of proxy wars, that put pressure on the West and make it more and more difficult to politically and militarily hold the position.

How do you think this will play out with deadlines hanging and new court drama ahead? Will new revelations cause an additional shift? Will info not even known to the Jan 6 select committee sway public opinion? 

So far, Trump’s legal team has proposed an argument about Trump wanting to protect witnesses ( when was this ever his concern?).  They claim that disclosing FBI interviews, unredacted documents, or sensitive details might expose individuals who provided testimony, making them vulnerable to threats or harassment.

Do you think this legal argument will prevent the release of the evidence appendix in whole or in part?


Background:
September 5, 2024: Trump’s legal team filed motions asking the court to dismiss the charges, arguing he should be immune from prosecution based on his role as president.

October 3, 2024: Both sides must submit pretrial evidence, documents, and other disclosures related to the case.

-Trump’s legal team’s argument against releasing certain information, primarily on the grounds that it would prejudice the upcoming election and taint the jury pool, was rejected by the court. The court found that the public’s right to access evidence and transparency outweighed concerns about potential bias or election interference. Judges often weigh these factors and may decide that withholding information could compromise the integrity of the legal process. Therefore, the request to withhold the information did not succeed.

What’s next:

On October 10, 2024, Trump’s legal team must file any objections to the redactions of certain government documents or evidence, which likely include FBI interviews, emails, and other investigative material tied to the January 6th case. The evidence set for release contains materials relevant to the charges, but redacted portions could involve sensitive or classified details. Trump’s team is expected to argue against these redactions in an attempt to protect specific information from becoming public.

Pretty much the whole western side of the state has seen substantial damage. Even a lot of the coast was heavily affected and many without power. 

Furthermore, NC was hit by heavy rains AND THEN they got more from Helene. A lot of western NC is completely destroyed. Asheville is pretty much uninhabitable at this time and most roads in and out are destroyed. 

It is a bit cynical to think about the political implications of this. In 2020, Trump won NC by about 74k votes (or by 1.4%). Buncombe County (Asheville) was won by Biden by 34k votes.

Assuming no other significant storms come through within the next month, it’s not difficult to imagine that the area will need months to even fully assess the damage.

B) economy. We’re being told the economy is doing fabulous but people are hurting. Prices are inflated and companies are price gouging. This was a much bigger issue just a couple months ago but voters are turning around on the issue. Still, if this comes back, this favors Trump. 

C) Ukraine and Gaza. Trump is a lot of things but perhaps the one thing both sides can agree on is that he’s not a war mongerer. Kamala was VP to Biden as both wars broke out under his watch.

Here are some quotes from Walz talking about it back in February:

* https://x.com/ArthurDelaneyHP/status/1820821417363152916

This is contrasted by the Republicans' positions, with them gradually opposing some of these services as they get caught in the crossfire of their anti-abortion agenda.

An Alabama Supreme Court ruling earlier this year put access in jeopardy there, and the other week Republicans blocked a bill to protect IVF access nationwide:

1fsy2iy,The upcoming dockworkers' strike and its implications,2024-09-30 11:18:49,76,197,"There is currently a movement to begin[ a dockworker's strike](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/25/dockworkers-strike-disrupt-economy-election-00181005) at a number of important East Coast ports in the coming days organized by union leader Harold Daggett. Such a strike, were it to occur, would dramatically drive up the prices of goods imported to the United States. These ports that are going on strike handle about half of all goods shipped to the U.S. in containers, so any such strike could have a serious impact right at the start of the holiday shopping season. It could also impact inflation rates—a political nightmare for any incumbent party looking to maintain power. With that in mind, I have two questions.

1. How likely is it that the effects of the strike will be as severe, and as long-lasting, as Daggett claims they are?

2. How badly will this affect Harris's campaign? She needs a good economic message to win the swing states, and this could compromise that.

But results of [Gallup's September polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/650774/favorable-ratings-harris-trump-remain.aspx) of the presidential candidates' favorability seem to run counter to what most other pollsters are finding.

Note: Two-thirds of this poll was taken before the debate, so Gallup may find significant movement in favorability ratings  when they conduct their final favorability polling of this cycle in a couple of weeks. Nonetheless, what they found isn't what I expected.

>Independents rate Trump better than Harris, 44% vs. 35%.

>Walz, Vance each viewed favorably by about four in 10 U.S. adults.

>Biden’s approval rating dips to 39% after last month’s 43% reading.

>Nearly identical percentages of U.S. adults rate **Donald Trump (46%)** and **Kamala Harris (44%)** favorably in Gallup’s latest **Sept. 3-15 poll**, during which the candidates debated for the first time. Both candidates, however, have higher unfavorable than favorable ratings. **Trump’s unfavorable rating is seven percentage points higher than his favorable score, and Harris’ is 10 points higher.**

>Harris’ bump in favorability after her unexpected nomination as the Democratic presidential nominee has moderated somewhat, while Trump’s favorability is up five points since last month, returning to the level he was at in June.

>Despite the overall negative tilt in favorability, both candidates enjoy nearly unanimous positive ratings from their own party faithful and negligible positivity from the opposing party.

3 major election models all show Harris as a slight favorite. (538, economist, Nate Silver's model at his sub stack) and Silver has at least said at this point he'd rather be Harris with the polls he is seeing. 

However we have two very clear data points with Trump on the ballot. In 2016 Trump pulled off a win when almost no one thought he had a chance. And in 2020 Biden had a clear win, but it ended up being *far* closer than the polls. In fact, projections the day before the election were that Biden would score pretty comfortable wins in the Blue wall and also pick up wins in FL and NC. Reviewing the polls of FL in particular shows Biden consistently being up 3-6 points. 

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/

For reference here is the final 538 projection but to summarize it gave Biden a 90% chance to win with likely wins in FL and NC and Iowa and TX being closish. Biden ended up losing FL pretty convincingly, and the polls were off by a good 5 points or so. 

Currently, all polling seems to show a super narrow Harris lead, often within the margin of error, even in the Blue wall states and Trump with clear leads in AZ, FL and more of a toss up in GA and NC. 

My question is:  Is there any objective reason or evidence to believe the polls are *not* once again underestimating Trump's support? They have under called Trump's vote by 3-5 points twice so far, why won't it happen again?

The investors want a truly autonomous state that independently conducts its internal and foreign policy.

Comments are saying this is illegal, and to call the police, only for other commenters to joke of the ineffectiveness of the police caring about this particular issue.

This was especially notable during COVID as well, where many sheriffs and police departments in republican leaning counties were saying that they would not enforce mask mandates, or other COVID-related policies.

1fpwf37,"Rank Choice Voting (RCV) has been proposed as a way to reduce partisanship, allow diversity of political parties and candidates, and empower voters. Would it work?",2024-09-26 09:38:51,365,243,"RCV means that instead of voting for one candidate, candidates are ranked -- who is the first choice, who is second, who third, etc. When votes are counted, a candidate receiving 50% or more of the votes immediately wins. If no candidate receives 50%, then the second choice of votes which supported the candidate with the fewest votes are given to the other candidates -- and so on for other candidates with lower vote totals until one candidate gets 50%. For example, in the 2004 presidential election in Florida, Bush received 2,912,790 votes, Gore 2,912,253 (a margin of 537 votes) and Ralph Nader received 97,488. If there had been RCV, the second choice of Nader voters would have been distributed between Bush and Gore.

RCV advocates suggest that RCV allows a greater range of candidates and political parties while freeing voters from worrying whether they should vote for a candidate with a better chance of winning rather than a less popular candidate who they would really prefer. In addition, since candidates must compete for second-choice support from their opponents’ supporters they will have less incentive to run negative campaigns.

He has said to have warned his counterpart not to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine; Russians at that time downplayed the concern over nuclear weapons.

The Russian policy at that time was to only use nuclear weapons if it faced existential threat or in response to a nuclear threat. The real response seems to have come two years later. Putin announced yesterday that any nation's conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country.

Granted, there has always been a sort of ideological link between Republicans and Libertarians that have made swing voters shift between those two parties. Should we expect an anomalous decrease in Libertarian support in favor of Trump due to Oliver’s nomination, or will the Libertarian vote generally remain around the same percentage?

Williams was convicted of murder in 2001, but significant concerns have emerged regarding the fairness of his trial and his actual guilt.

Former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens paused the execution in 2017 and formed a special board to review the evidence, indicating there was enough doubt to warrant further investigation. Additionally, new DNA evidence, along with mishandling of key evidence like the murder weapon, has raised more questions about the conviction. The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney has also expressed concerns that Williams’ constitutional rights were violated, and the victim’s widower has opposed the death penalty in this case.

Despite these issues, Governor Parson disbanded the board in 2022 and initiated efforts to set an execution date, which is now scheduled for today.

Edit: Note that technocratic government doesn't say whether the actual leader is some sort of scientific genius, it's just that they have no partisan background and is merely there to administer legislation with essentially no original ideas.

My theoretical question is, If the Democrats in the house were to not support this bill, therefore allowing a government shutdown, would the American public punish the GOP majority in the 2024 election? Would voters view the house governing majority as ineffective and would this have consequences in November? Or is it in the Democrats' best interest to keep the government funded.

[NTEU Endorses Harris for President - National Treasury Employees Union - NTEU](https://www.nteu.org/media-center/news-releases/2024/09/18/endorsementrelease?hatchact=non-government-computer)



The National Treasury Employees Union has endorsed Kamala Harris for President of the United States.

NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald announced the decision after extensive research into the candidates’ records regarding the federal workforce, and consultation with NTEU members and chapter leaders across the country.

“When it comes to treating federal employees with respect, valuing their service and investing in their work, Kamala Harris is the clear choice,” Greenwald said. “She shares our values and our commitment to making sure that the federal government works for all Americans. She has been a strong advocate for the issues that matter most to federal employees: fair pay, paid family leave, adequate agency funding and staffing, and robust collective bargaining rights.”

Does this play into Former President Trump's claim that there is a big state and that the big state supports Democrats? The NTEU encompasses 35 government agencies; you can see the complete list at: [www.nteu.org/who-we-are/our-agencies](http://www.nteu.org/who-we-are/our-agencies)

The right is arguably more radicalized than ever. The liberal coalition is more complicated with perhaps less political ambition than in 2020 but also a more solidified progressive wing angry at the current status-quo.  Like most historical trends though it is hard to judge success in the moment. The question I would have is, are the conditions for depolarization established and if so what does that mean. 

The Right: (Potential lines of inquiry)

1. Will the right accept defeat in 2024 if it comes or try to take a more militant stance?

2. If the right wins will it attempt to win a larger coalition by moderating its views or embrace a vision of overthrowing the status-quo? e.g the 2025 plan 

3. Has the experience of running unelectable candidates in winnable states (Lake, Robinson) begun to sour the right on a lack of political pragmatism?

4. Will the right fight or concede on it's unpopular stance on trying to limit abortion?

  
The Left: 

1. Will the Liberal-Left try to push America towards a more progressive cultural understanding or attempt to consolidate post 2010s gains at the expense of further equity efforts or concede some post 2010s gain in an effort to gain control of the center?

2. Will the Liberal-Left coalition break apart or stay together over differences on issues like Israel?

His administration’s approach has been a departure from the strict policies of the Trump era, and it has garnered mixed reactions from both sides of the aisle.

Biden’s policies have included the following key actions:

	•	Ending Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy (formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols), which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were processed in U.S. courts.
	•	Rolling back family separation practices and prioritizing more humane treatment for migrants.
	•	Utilizing Title 42, a pandemic-era health law that allowed the expulsion of migrants on public health grounds, although this policy was eventually phased out in 2023.
	•	Increasing funding for border security while trying to manage a humanitarian crisis at the border by investing in the region’s economies to address root causes of migration, such as poverty and violence in Central America.

Despite these efforts, the administration has faced criticism. Some argue that Biden’s policies have led to a surge in border crossings, overwhelming border facilities and straining local resources. Others say that his efforts to balance enforcement and humanitarianism have been inadequate in both areas—too lenient for immigration hardliners and too harsh for progressive advocates.

With Kamala Harris being tasked with overseeing the administration’s efforts on border diplomacy and immigration, how might this affect her potential candidacy in a future election?

It would seem that there's a section of the GOP members, and supposedly endorsed by the House Republican campaign management, that are coming out as being against ""extreme"" positions on abortion in either direction.

Now that seems like it's already trying to couch it in language they can walk back if they need to. 

But the picture painted by the article suggests that Republicans (as a party at least) are quite earnestly trying to swing the needle on abortion stances now that they've realized how much of a stone around their neck it is. Historically the support for restricting it is traditionally associated with the GOP. Combine that with their own insistence on returning the issue to the states who then immediately begin trying to enforce anti-abortion restrictions and the consequences (such as the two women in Georgia) being traced back to them at a national level.

Very much seems like a dog caught the car kind of moment so it would make an amount of sense to try to pivot away.

But the sticking point for me is that the GOP has relied on the evangelical voting bloc for decades now to help them in elections. If they soften their stance on this at a party level do you think the evangelicals will abandon them? Will they stick around and begrudgingly vote? Did a large chunk of the evangelical vote already leave because Roe v Wade was overturned?

Or is this a purely cynical political move by the GOP that will only last until the POTUS election is done?

The Trump campaign and many of its supporters have signaled for years that they intend to subvert the election results.  So:

What is going to happen if (and when) the Trump campaign and the broader MAGA effort goes through with (in many cases: long-planned) efforts in one or more of these categories:   
- to stop proper vote tabulation and  certification in many different states.   
- to engage in late stage voter suppression (whatever longer-term voter suppression tactics they ahve already put into place will already have worked to one degree or another?  
- even though they already tried this tactic in the prior election, and so it might be harder to try this time, it is quite possible they will try again to stop proper functioning of the electoral college
- to cause legal chaos and get the election into the federal courts where it can be decided in favor of Trump by a pliant and partially-corrupt Supreme Court.
- if, somehow, Trump still loses after all of their campaign's efforts not to accept the legal results of the electoral college, it is possible that there might still be an attempt to break up the country, via attempted secession of one or more states.

What is the best strategy here for Biden, and for Harris to anticipate, forestall, and counter these efforts by the Trump Campaign, many of which have been long-signaled by them, so they are not exactly a secret?

Harris/Waltz is no longer the honeymoon phase and current plus past momentum is moving in the same direction theoretically putting Texas and Florida in play.



The numbers today on 538 show a 60-64% chance of Harris winning the election and Trump at 38% with the projected electoral college win being 300-238. That wasn't the part that really caught my eye. What caught my eye is when you scroll down to the state by state breakdown, they have Texas listed as 71-74% Trump to win and Florida as 65-68% chance to win.



I can't get out of my head how improbable it seems as I think of Texas as a Republican stronghold, but the data is saying there is a chance. I realize that Texas always voted democratic for 150 years until Reagan ran for office, but that was before my time so I just think of them as a red state.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028.

Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses.

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent.",PoliticalDiscussion,0.0,2024-09-17,"republicans blocked bill protect ivf access nationwide america. thoughts this, impact think election?"

We live in a time where **political polarization** seems to be at an all-time high, and I'm beginning to wonder if the **two-party system** is the root cause. Both major parties—**Democrats** and **Republicans**—claim to represent the interests of the people, but it feels like more and more people are dissatisfied, and for good reason.

* **On one hand**, Democrats push for progressive reforms, but often seem out of touch with the working-class, rural voters. Is the Democratic Party focusing too much on identity politics and not enough on policies that benefit everyday people?
* **On the other hand**, Republicans claim to represent freedom and economic growth, but seem entrenched in supporting big corporations and outdated values that alienate younger voters and minorities. Are they truly protecting ""freedom"" or just corporate interests?

This got me wondering: **What if both parties have lost their way?**

What do you all think? Are these two parties **still capable of representing all Americans** or are they just perpetuating a broken system? Should we seriously consider **third-party alternatives**, or even a complete **revamp of how our democracy works**? And if so, what would that look like?

That’s why as President, Kamala Harris will create an Opportunity Economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed—whether they live in a rural area, small town, or big city. Vice President Kamala Harris has made clear that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency. That’s why she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans. As President, she will fight to cut taxes for more than 100 million working and middle class Americans while lowering the costs of everyday needs like health care, housing, and groceries. She will bring together organized labor and workers, small business owners, entrepreneurs, and American companies to create good paying jobs, grow the economy, and ensure that America continues to lead the world.""

Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump passed record-setting tax relief for the middle class, doubled the child tax credit, and slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. Real wages quickly increased as a result, and median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country, while poverty reached a record low.

There was an interesting article in the Bulwark today

https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-is-the-main-character-of-2024


To summarize, the article basically states that Trump wants the news cycle to be about him, and has distracted from his horrible debate performance to discussion of his false claims about pets being eaten in Springfield 

Taking it as a given that Trump always wants to be the center of attention, one of the claims that some ""undecided"" voters still make is that they don't know enough about Harris to support her yet

So, questions:

* Is the election being a referendum on Trump to the benefit of Harris?

1fi2lfd,"Could Kamala Harris Win Against a Candidate Like Mitt Romney, or Is Trump Making Her Look Stronger?",2024-09-16 07:51:47,9,28,"So, with Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee, we’re seeing a lot of her rallies and interviews, not to mention the debates. I think we can all agree that Trump really doesn’t deserve to be elected president again, given his chaotic and polarizing track record. The contrast between Harris and Trump is massive, and to many, that makes her the obvious choice. 

But here’s what I’ve been thinking about: when I listen to Harris in rallies, her talking points about growing up middle class and creating an ""opportunity economy"" sound great. These are the kind of lines that fire people up. But in interviews, wouldn’t it make sense for her to go a bit deeper into policy instead of repeating the same points?

I’ve watched a lot of interviews with Obama, and he just seems so thorough and “professor-like” in his answers. He digs into the details and shows that he knows exactly what he’s talking about. Obama didn’t just stick to talking points; he broke down complex issues like healthcare, the economy, or foreign policy in a way that felt really thoughtful. Harris, on the other hand, sometimes feels like she stays a bit on the surface.

Could Kamala Harris still be as ahead if she were running against someone like Mitt Romney - someone who gave Obama a close race rather than Donald Trump? Trump creates this obvious stability vs. chaos contrast, where Harris benefits from simply being a competent, level-headed alternative. 

But what if she were running against someone more conventional, someone more focused on policy like Mitt Romney? Romney, for all his faults, gave Obama a close race back in 2012, largely because he came across as competent, experienced, and well-versed in policy.

 In that kind of race, could Harris’ style hold up as well? Would she need to shift away from the broad emotional appeals and start digging into the kind of policy depth that Obama was so good at?

If we look at the past several presidential candidates—Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and now Kamala Harris—none of them seem to fit the description of true progressives. Most of these candidates have embraced centrist policies, often appealing to moderates and independents rather than the more progressive wing of the party.

While some argue that recent Democratic platforms are more progressive on issues like healthcare and climate change, are these shifts substantial enough to be called a move toward the left? Or are they simply keeping pace with changing public opinion while maintaining a centrist core?

In the lead-up to the 2020 Democratic primaries, centrist candidates and establishment figures quickly consolidated their influence, rallying behind Joe Biden after early victories by more left-wing contenders like Bernie Sanders. As the primary unfolded, the moderate wing of the party wielded its power to sideline populist candidates and their policies, pushing for a more “electable” candidate in Biden. This realignment led to the abandonment of progressive healthcare reform, with Medicare for All falling out of favor. Similarly, despite the mass mobilization of Black Lives Matter protests and the popularity of environmental movements like the Green New Deal, these causes were largely deprioritized by the establishment. As Biden took office, there was minimal progress on both fronts, leaving the populist left frustrated and seeing little meaningful advancement on these key issues. The graph of influence shows the centrist bloc spiking in power as the primaries progressed, while momentum for progressive policies flattened post-election.

Would this not be seen as centrist continuity?",PoliticalDiscussion,0.05,2024-09-15,democratic party really shifting toward center?

There are exceptions of course but if Republican politicians want to survive electorally they have to be sycophantic in their support for Trump, lie for him, kiss his ring and even believe and justify everything he says a regardless of how untrue or otherwise disgusting it is. 

Even the RNC itself has a member of the trump family at it’s head. Legislatures and congress pass or don’t pass bills based off of what Trump demands, and it’s very rare for republicans who do not like trump(be it politicians or even average people) to not become pariahs of the GOP or even family members. 

And my question is what will happen to the GOP once trump is gone? He’s an old man and clearly in poor health. He will die of old age one day but because the GOP is centered around him and no one else who has tried to become his successor has succeeded or been anywhere near as successful(DeSantis, JD Vance, etc.) how will the GOP survive? 

Having studied cults and and cults of personality in particular for a long time, to me there are only three options: either the whole party essentially collapses and devolves into infighting, destroying itself in the process much like Millerites, the  GOP undergoes a process akin to de-Stalinization such as what happened in the USSR under Khrushchev and moderates itself somewhat, or an insofar unnamed successor emerges from an internal power struggle and becomes the new charismatic leader of the party(IE: David Miscavage from Scientology or JF Rutherford of the Jehovah’s Witnesses).

Very flawed. Granted, these thoughts are held for extremely different reasons: the right thinks it’s flawed because their guy says so, with no hard evidence or examples. The left thinks it flawed because the US has a history of disenfranchising large categories of people such as women, Blacks, Native Americans, people of color, etc, all who have had to fight and struggle for their right to vote. This disenfranchisement continues today, most notably with felon disenfranchisement laws in various states, as well as measures to simply limit and restrict voting.

The US is essentially unique these days in that prosecutors for the most part are elected, and the ones who aren't are usually substantially political appointments and not civil servants. Some others using common law are more like civil servants, although some of the high ups of the departments may have more politics in the appointment. 

Most countries using civil law such as the Netherlands do not use nearly so much leeway, although there are some policies the department may issue, such as those pertaining to drugs where there is a policy of not prosecuting the possession of cannabis up to five grams per person who is a legal adult, even though in the law, it is not actually legal, and to prosecute someone despite this would be so rare as to constitute illegal selective prosecution. The idea is the rule of law, in that no human should be able to alter the law by their own decision, either what it says or what it does in practice, and that problems in the law should be adjusted and changed by the legislative authority and not by the judiciary or the executive, and encourages the discussion of the law in the legislature and general elections rather than ignoring what the law is for convenience.

Again, I did not really touch on current polling (or “vibes”) when I made that post, and I am curious how these states’ (and a couple others’) polls will look over the next couple of weeks.

One could argue that with the “win” from the debate and large amounts of money raised, this is the prime time to capitalize on NC and potentially make a serious play in FL and TX, or at least do enough to put the Trump campaign on defensive in these once safe/lean R states.

One could also argue that despite the optimism, the Harris campaign should not get sidetracked and instead continue to ensure they at least win the electoral college, even if that means losing a couple states like GA and AZ by focusing much more on the Midwest.

Any thoughts on how the Harris campaign will proceed? Would the Harris campaign be better off with focusing all their efforts on maintaining what she and Biden won in 2020? Or would it depend how polls are trending in the next few/several weeks — especially now that we just had the first (and likely only) debate between Harris and Trump?",PoliticalDiscussion,0.1,2024-09-12,"asked month ago, i’ll ask now: state(s) could kamala walz *realistically* try win biden win 2020 (flip red blue)?"

",2024-09-13 11:08:57,0,83,"Which is more real, and which is more impactful: alleged electoral fraud (usually attributed, these days, to Democrats) and/or alleged voter suppression (usually attributed to Republicans)?  

We have two competing allegations here, both of which are about to come up in a very big way in discussions, as we head into, and hold, the Presidential election in the US.  Both electoral fraud (or vote fraud as many Republicans have been calling it) and voter suppression are types of ways to undermine the integrity and fairness of a voting system.  Those who allege one of the actions seldom seem to acknowledge that the other also occurs to a strong degree.

In general, it is thought by some that more voter turnout helps Democrats and less voter turnout helps Republicans.  If the allegations on either side were true then in theory it would probably generally help Democrats if electoral fraud were widespread and it would probably generally help Republicans if Voter Suppression were widespread.

Now, to summarize the allegations:

On the one hand Republicans frequently allege that Democrats are all-too-willing to accept and work for an unfair advantage by various activities that fall under the heading of electoral or voter fraud.  The accusations particularly include malicious programming of computerized systems, voting by those who do not legally have the right to vote, and insecure improper handling of both computer and hard-copy sensitive records.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral\_fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud)



On the other hand Democrats (and others) frequently allege that Republicans are engaged in such widespread and impactful Voter Suppression that the US system is badly rigged against the Democrats.  The specific allegations include improper removal of legitimate voters from registration lists (often under pretext of removing names of those who should not be registered), gerrymandering, severe unwarranted restrictions on places to cast votes in a reasonably timely way, and restrictions on mail-in voting.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter\_suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression)



Both sides generally deny the validity of the allegations against them.  In the case of the allegations against the Democrats, it can be added as a matter of publicly-available information that at least some of the electoral fraud allegations were recently investigated by various parties including those funded by legislatures, and generally found by the courts to be baseless allegations, in the aftermath of the 2020 election.",PoliticalDiscussion,0.07142857142857141,2024-09-13,"real, impactful: alleged electoral fraud (usually attributed, days, democrats) and/or alleged voter suppression (usually attributed republicans)?"

Trump appears to be trying to frame himself as a 'moderate' on abortion, that he supports leaving it to the states and he has nothing to do with Project 2025. However, he is continuously unable to rule out federal restrictions, which Project 2025 calls for, and occasionally references policies to curtail it nationally that are straight out of Project 2025. For instance, last month he alluded to appointing a right wing FDA commissioner that could rescind the 2000 authorization of Mifepristone (the abortion pill), which would go into effect in all 50 states:

I know nothing about economics- hence why I’m here- so I’d thought I’d want to ask this question on this subreddit and I’m looking forward to really well-thought out, in-depth and fact-based, detailed responses to really answer this question that I’ve just had in my head.
I commonly see a lot of people say that the reason why the US has inflation now is all because of Biden’s fault- that Biden is the cause of the US’ inflation. Now, a common counter-argument to that is if Biden is the cause of the US’ inflation, then why are we seeing inflation around the globe- it isn’t that Biden caused inflation, but that inflation is just a global trend that the US is sadly a victim of- therefore, Biden didn’t cause the US’ inflation because inflation is just a global thing. But another common counter to that argument is since the dollar is the “world’s global reserve currency”, that means that if inflation happens in the US then inflation around the world will immediately follow. But does that argument actually hold up? I don’t have an answer to that because I didn’t study economics in school.

I also came across Texas and Michigan investing heavily on them: [New $305 million Austin State Hospital unveiled | The Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/15/texas-psychiatric-hospitals-mental-health/) and [New $85M psychiatric hospital preparing to open in Michigan - mlive.com](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2023/06/new-85m-psychiatric-hospital-preparing-to-open-in-michigan.html#:~:text=Beyond%20the%20Caro%20facility%2C%20Michigan,to%20aging%20infrastructure%2C%20officials%20said.).

1fegptu,Who will be the next Senate Democratic Leader after Chuck Schumer retires?,2024-09-11 14:01:20,124,100,"*Who will be the next Senate Democratic Leader after Chuck Schumer retires?*

Chuck Schumer (D-NY), the Senate Majority Leader and chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus, is currently 73 years old and [filing to run for re-election in 2028](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/S8NY00082/1661663/). Notwithstanding a change in political tides or health, he is set to lead Senate Democrats for many years to come.

Leadership succession for Senate Democrats has been fairly routine since LBJ redefined the position's power in the 1950s; the sitting Whip would succeed the Leader. However, Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip since 2005, will turn 80 this year. He has, however, filed to run for re-election in 2026. 

Whether or not Schumer stays as Democratic leader for the next decade, or if he steps down before then - say, to become [president pro tempore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate) if everyone above him in seniority retires - who are the likely contenders to replace him? 

This question has been asked before on Reddit, on subreddits like r/neoliberal, but only mentioning senators who are in the news often or former presidential candidates. Here are some qualifications I had in mind; they may seem obvious but I believe they merit description:

* Individuals with a proven record of success and loyal service to the Senate Democratic leadership. Fundraising is key here.
* Individuals who are able to articulate the viewpoints of all factions of Senate Democrats without being pigeonholed into any specific faction. A talented messenger.
* Individuals without significant controversy. No one inside or outside the Senate would be outraged beyond normal ""politics"" at their selection.
* Individuals already in the leadership. Deputy whips, caucus vice chairs, caucus secretary, etc.
* Individuals who don't upset the regional balance in the leadership.

To throw my answer into the ring, [Chris Van Hollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Van_Hollen) (D-MD) comes to mind. Without being too detailed, his entry in the latest *Almanac of American Politics* made a deep impression. I'd also mention Gary Peters, Brian Schatz and Amy Klobuchar as up-and-comers currently in the leadership who are young enough by Senate standards.

1. While in the House, Van Hollen was the [House Dems' lead elections coordinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee) from 2007 to 2011 (the [2008 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections): 21-seat gain for Dems) and a trusted lieutenant of Nancy Pelosi. 
2. Van Hollen's campaign experience in the House resulted in his selection as the [DSCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee) chair (campaign recruitment and funding for the Senate Democrats) six weeks before even joining the Senate. It mirrors how Schumer came into Harry Reid's trust through his outstanding work at the DSCC in the 2006 and 2008 Senate elections.
3.  Van Hollen was also cited in the Almanac for talent as both a politician and policy wonk. I also haven't seen any prominent disputes between Van Hollen and Schumer. The only real drawback is that aside from being DSCC chair from 2017 to 2019, Van Hollen is no longer in the Senate leadership.

I have a hard time understanding why so many people hate Christianity/Catholicism and I would like to genuinely know why some people do. 

I understand that the religion has caused many atrocities and been mismanaged, but simply studying history will show that it's not the only religion to do this. 

I also understand about the thought that it subjugates women but there are other religions that mutilate the genitals of women and others that force women to wear burkas. Many have even been murdered if they are caught not wearing them correctly or if they're caught outside without a man or even if they're caught learning in school. I also know about the topic of abortion but numerous religions are against it in addition to Catholicism. Some religions believe that women are nothing but a baby machine and encourage men to have multiple wives and treat their women like meat. 

It is also a fact that not only Christianity frowns upon gay marriage and some religions even murder gay people or force them to transition to the other gender so they wouldn't be considered ""gay"" anymore. 

There's also the glaring issue of molestation and rape cases in the Catholic Church but there is much evidence to suggest that the same rates can be found in nearly every religion and that there is even higher rates when it comes to schools. 

Finally the only reason I can think of for people hating this religion is due to religious trauma where people say they were kicked out and disowned by family when they didn't want to be the same religion. Also a lot of cases of religious abuse leads to this, I believe.But there are also countless stories where other religions do the same thing and in some cases, they do even worse than Catholics. 

This is not to disrespect any other religions I am just genuinely curious to know why people have such distain for Catholics/Christians. Is it because people don't know that other religions do the same things and sometimes even worse? Is it because it isn't reported as much with other religions? Even with religious abuse it seems like there is a spotlight on Christianity and the stories of abuse from other religions are thrown to the wayside.

But I didn’t hear much about specific, local infrastructure projects funded by recent federal acts—like the Fort Jenkins and Water Street bridge replacements in Pennsylvania or similar projects in other states.

Given that these kinds of projects have direct impacts on local communities (improving safety, creating jobs, boosting local economies), I would think highlighting them could help connect with voters by showing tangible results from signature policies from the Biden / Harris administration. Why might her campaign (or any national campaign) avoid promoting specific local projects? Is there a strategic reason for focusing on broader issues rather than pointing to real, visible projects on the ground? Or would mentioning these local wins be more effective in connecting with voters?

Each source I've read about the process if no presidential candidate reaches 270 Electoral College votes makes it clear that the vote goes to the House and the vote is cast by state delegations rather than by each of the 435 House members. 

There can be 50 votes cast. Republicans have majority control of 26 state delegations, Democrats have majority control of 22 delegations, while Minnesota and North Carolina are tied. 

How does that state delegation vote happen?

1. Does ""majority control of 26 state delegations"" simply mean a majority of a state's elected House members are Republican?
2. Does each state House member get one vote, and the majority of that vote gets to cast their preferred vote in the House?

In Brazil, the Centrão (lit. 'big centre') is a term for a large bloc of political parties that do not have a specific or consistent ideological orientation and whose aim is to maintain proximity to the executive branch in order to guarantee advantages and allow them to distribute privileges through clientelistic networks.[6] The Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) is one of the oldest and most notable ""Centrão"" and Big Tent parties in Brazil; despite being Brazil's largest party, both in number of members and number of officials elected, it has never elected a President, but has used its position as the largest party as a ""bargaining chip"" for privileges and advantages.[7] MDB was founded in 1965 at the start of the Brazilian military dictatorship as part of an enforced two-party system by the dictatorship, in which the only allowed parties were National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA), a catch-all party representing the interests of the dictatorship, and MDB, formed to represent a wide-range moderate and less radical opposition to the dictatorship, without a clear program except the democratization of the country.[8] Other Big Tent centrão parties include the Progressists (PP), Brazilian Labour Party (PTB), We Can (PODE), Brazil Union (UB), Social Democratic Party (PSD), Social Christian Party (PSC), Act (AGIR), Patriot (PATRI), Forward (AVANTE), Solidarity (SD).[9]

In Brazilian politics, the centrão (lit. 'big centre' – Portuguese pronunciation: [se᷉'tɾɐ᷉w᷉]) refers to a group of political parties that do not have a specific or consistent ideological orientation and aim at ensuring proximity to the executive branch in order to guarantee advantages and allow them to distribute privileges through clientelistic networks. Despite its name, the centrão is not a centrist political group,[1] generally composed of parliamentarians from the ""lower clergy [pt]""[2] and big tent parties,[3] who act according to their own interests, linked to cronyism and logrolling.[4][5]

She wants to provide up to $25,000 to help home owners with their down payment on a house. She wants to cut taxes for the middle class and those with children. She wants to go after the cost of health care and cancel 7 billion in medical debt. She wants to raise minimum wage. This is just a handful of her talk points on her website.

What I mean is, we have data and examples going back thousands of years on how certain policies affect a governed people.

I understand that societies evolve and societal wants and needs change, but shouldn't the core principles and policy drivers still basically be constant? Maybe not something as simple or elegant as PV=nRT (ah, volume goes up so pressure must go down or temp must go up), but... something... 

Like why are we still having debates (not the most recent presidential debate, but more like a generic political discourse) where one politician can say (just as a random example - I am not picking a political side one way or another - if you feel this example leans too far toward one side, make up another in your head going the other direction) ""I will cut taxes to promote spending"" and another will respond with something vague like ""we know that doesn't work"" or ""we've seen in the past that that's not how it plays out"" and then they just kind of... move on without anything changing. The first politician can just respond ""you're wrong"" or ""my plan is 'different'"" or ""'better'"" and we are just left to accept that that is that.

Why aren't they responding with something with explicit citations? ""My fellow candidate, that may be your ""opinion"" on the policy, but as the data has proven time and time again in cases X, Y, and Z, dating back to 1923, your ""opinion"" is as valid as that of believing the earth is flat.""

Of course that is getting more into political discourse theory. My question is more around the idea that shouldn't we have ""answers"" for most of the common issues by now? I guess, why do we (myself absolutely included) lack even a basic education and understanding of political science and theory?

I feel like things would be much more amicable for society (or at least far less polarizing) if we were all (conservatives, liberals, middlers, whatever) like ""dude, we all learned in 3rd grade polisci that your plan is idiotic, get off the stage... next!""

I realize there's also a subtext that ""yes, I know that it doesn't work the way I am stating it, but it will benefit me and those who support me.. and if I can state it in such a way that you believe it will also benefit you, then you will vote for me.""

I also realize that politicians on both sides want people to be less educated on the policies so that they can manipulate them and come in as a sort of savior with their genius plans.

I am trying to understand why and how of everything that lead to US invasion of iraq and the disaster that came with it. From oil, to neo conservative actually caring for Democracy but no ideas how to do it, from bush administration relying on Iraqi exiled who don't know anything about current iraq in 2002, to disband the Iraqi army and not enough US soldiers in Iraq to keep things in orders. 
But one things that really got me is De-Ba'athification and usa actually increased the power of shiite in Iraq. But seriously did George W Bush forgot that Iranian are shiite? and shiite do favor Iran than other sunni countries and even the USA itself. So you are telling me that none of whole experts told bush or Paul bremer about the inevitable iran influence?
Bush himself called Iran as one the Axis of evil. Another thing to consider is that De-Ba'athification is often compared to Denazification, but anyone who had to join the Ba'ath Party just to get a job (as was required under Saddam's regime) could no longer hold that job after the U.S. invasion. Meanwhile, a former chief of staff under Hitler, Adolf Heusinger, became a NATO leader. I guess my whole question can be summarized as: Did George W.

1fcg6hw,Why do the US parties project such confidence in the run-up to (presidential?) elections?  ,2024-09-08 23:31:27,1,3,"In the UK, there tends to be at least one party - usually the one in the lead - downplaying their chances at the next election, to try and avoid voters becoming complacent and thinking the election outcome is a done deal. In the general election earlier this year, Labour (who went on to win a landslide in terms of seats) downplayed their chances until the exit poll and remained reticent about expressing too much optimism until several hours into the count when it was clear who had won.

Following the US election across the pond, representatives (and supporters) of both major parties seem keen to emphasise how well their party Is doing in the campaign and the fact they think they're going to win. To the extent that there are partisan pollsters with results showing their party in the lead. We have a couple of dodgy pollsters in the UK, but the parties often say not to look at the polls.

I've seen multiple interviews with representatives of both parties where they are asked, with reference to polling numbers, if they can really win the November, and they all responded confidently that they were on track to win. In the UK general election campaign, I watched so many interviews with Labour politicians where it was the complete opposite, with the interview suggesting they were heading for a landslide and the interviewee downplaying their chances.

I know there are big and well-funded, register-to-vote campaigns (I've seen many Democratic ones) and that there are  'get out the vote' operations closer to election day (and on the day itself). (Particularly, I think, for the Democrats?) These are clearly intended to combat the issue of complacency and drive up voter turnout, but I don't understand why both parties - knowing it'll be a close race (in the electoral college at least) - downplay their chances to make voters think their vote can make the difference.

I've come up with the following possible explanations, but I'm not really sure which one, if any, is correct.

1. The sort of thing I described happening in the UK does happen in the US and I've just missed it.
2. Parties will be stressing how close the race is in adverts and interviews targeted in swing states, but want to project confidence on the national stage to make people they're running a successful campaign is successful. (If so, I would have missed them as I'm not following the race in enough detail to know what swing state voters are seeing.)
3. American voters are more likely to back someone they perceive as a winner, so being viewed as being ahead of your opponent attracts enough votes to offset those lost to complacency.
4. The UK parties' structures mean that the party HQ have more influence over the messaging going out to voters, so it is possible to maintain a more consistent message. 

Or perhaps it's something completely different.

  
A few notes (reading these is not essential to understand my question, but may help):

* To pre-empt any comments saying that Labour is particularly cautious about expressing optimism after 1992: Yes, but I'm not sure that explains all the difference. From what I've seen, the party in front in the UK tends to stress how close the race is (even when it isn't) and I've also been surprised by the lack of expectation management, compared to the UK. Though that would probably be a different post (and not one I'd write, as I'm not 100% on the US parties' approaches).
* I'm obviously not as familiar with US politics as the stuff going on in the UK, but I do follow it quite closely and studied it in a decent amount of detail as part of a Politics A Level (a weird qualification that's difficult to translate for Americans, we do three in our equivalent of the last two years of high school). There was a time when I could explain how Congress passed a bill in a silly amount of detail, unfortunately, that time has now passed. Still, you can treat me like I know the basics of how US elections work and how the parties are structured.
* I've only followed US elections from 2020 onwards and can't remember the parties' messaging in the run-up to the 2022 midterms, hence the '(presidential)' in the question.
* This isn't an attempt to criticise the US parties. I'm well aware they are extensive and capable campaigns that dwarf those in the UK. To make it exceedingly clear, I don't think the difference is going to be caused by political parties in the UK being smarter having figured out a trick the US parties haven't.

Cold War is considered to have ended in 1990s after Berlin Wall fell, and dismantling of the war saw pact. I’ve always contended however that until Nato admits Russia. There would be no end to the Cold War since the balance of power theory suggests that weaker nations will align against the hegemonic power as a means of survival. Which is exactly what we’ve seen over the past 20-30 years. Russia and China have formed an alliance to counteract western power. And many of soviet unions old puppet states aside from Eastern Europe are still aligned with them, Venezuela Cuba etc. Not only that but they seem to be adding new members and although brics is not a military alliance, an economic alliance is sometimes a precursor to one. what are historians take on this?",Ask_Politics,-0.056818181818181816,2024-09-08,new era considered new cold war extension old one
1fanaal,Rules Update - Increased sourcing requirements,2024-09-06 15:10:30,9,2,"As we get closer to the election, we're seeing a greater and greater number of top-level replies that often times lack a single source even as they go about referencing things that are not common knowledge.

While it is not an absolute requirement for top-level answers, except for only the most basic questions, sources should be used.

We are increasing this for a few reasons.

1. The ultimate goal here is to increase political knowledge.  The only way to really do that is to expose people to more and more concepts, history and analysis.  You might cite the 1996 Presidential elections, for example, and even the wiki link for that election contains a lot of information that might be useful in answering that question or clarifying your answer.  Or perhaps another community member reads that source and comes with a completely different outcome to it... when has that ever happened in politics?
2. By having to bring in sources, responses tend to be much less emotional and end up being fairly more detailed.  By bringing in the 1996 Presidential election, you notice that Florida was blue back then, flipping back to red, then blue, now red.  Perhaps that paints something else in your answer or, at very least, gives you the opportunity to note there could be other factors at play.

3. It will create a standard that we hope will bring the entire community up to the level we want.  If in doubt, provide a citation for things that aren't in recent history.  Political nerds might know topics reflexively, but not everyone does.  And more education is almost always a good thing.

(I'm just using the 1996 election as an example and ironically stumbled upon a few interesting things... so it even impacts us!)

In all the democracies that I know, even if parties of course have a preference on what policies they want to enact, the decision on which one to vote always end up in the hands of the candidates themselves. So, some of them might vote for something that their party didn't wanted. So my idea was, make each vote be actually two with some kind of automatic runnof. For example, suppose there are 10 seats in X party, 8 of them vote for enabling a policy while the other 2 doesn't. Instead of these being the votes in the final calculation, since the majority of the votes of the party were to enable it, it instead makes it so the party gains the vote, which would be 10 votes for enabling the policy.

The potential downsides are more substantial:

- there is a probability putin use nukes. He'll use the small bomb on his territory to stop the Ukrainian advance. This would be justified and terrorizing;

- while atacking in Kursk Ukraine will lose Pokrovsk and eventually whole Donbas;

- the western opositon against helping Ukraine  gains a sound argument since Ukraine acts in Kursk as agressor;

- there is a risk that Ukrainian troops will engage in masacre of russian civilians. This is not difficul to initiae or even stage.

For me the whole decission looks more like a risky gambling then rational plan. So why did Ukraine invade Russia? Am I beeing myopic on this one?

1erfnng,2024 homeless encampments and 1935 Hoovervilles?,2024-08-13 14:41:00,5,7,"As various cities and states presently grapple with unhoused people, impoverished immigrants, and feared asylum seekers, I cannot help but see these encampments as analogous to the Hoovervilles of 1935 and the Great Depression.

I was taught that Hoovervilles were tragic: the urban and suburban cousins of the moving images of Dust Bowl rural catastrophe, endemic of economic and societal failures, worthy of empathy, caring, and anger on their behalf -- a vision of disaster we Americans would never allow again. Bread lines, soup kitchens, men wearing signs about their plight and wish for work enough to feed and house their families.

Today's encampments are portrayed and treated even by left-leaning mayors/governors/etc as something different: dangerous, crime-addled bums and 'illegals,' whose possessions and tents should be tossed in the trash, the area they were in policed for safety and assigned taskforces to keep the encampment from re-establishing itself and soothe the locals.


Am I naive to see a connection between these two things? If so, what political and social factors make them irreconcilably different, deserving of different treatment? Are there lessons from that era we should be considering?

Or was my secondary school lessons about the Great Depression and Hoovervilles just sanitized historical propaganda, and people and politicians acted much the same as today... ?",Ask_Politics,0.0,2024-08-13,2024 homeless encampments 1935 hoovervilles?

1eo0z7p,How much do mid-sized metro areas spilling over state lines impact elections? ,2024-08-09 10:22:07,7,1,"Context: 
In the US, many mid sized metro areas spill across state lines. We know that urban centres tend to be more Democratic, and that it's winning over the suburbs of these urban centres (ie the wider metro area) which are instrumental to winning elections. Bluer states have bluer suburbs, and redder states redder ones. In general suburbs are still lean blue, but there is huge heterogeneity across the nation. 

Question:
Notice that in the US, many mid-sized metro areas spill across state lines. We have the Cincinnati, OH area spilling into KY, with many of Cincinnati's southern suburbs falling into KY. 

We have about half of the metro areas of St Louis, MO and Kansas City, MO falling into IL and KS respectively.

We have a small part of Charlotte's (NC) commuter belt falling into SC. 

A larger example is the Philadelphia, PA metro spilling into DL and NJ. 

My question is this: if, hypothetically, state boundaries were readjusted so that MSAs fell into one state (the same one as where the core of the metro area lies) rather than being split across state lines, how much would this impact election races? 

Eg if the Southern Cincinnati suburbs were absorbed into Ohio, would this make Ohio competitive for Democrats again? 

Eg If the Eastern St Louis and Western Kansas City suburbs were absorbed into Missouri, would this make Missouri competitive for Democrats again?  

And finally a much larger & perhaps most consequential example: if the Philadelphia PA suburbs in NJ and DL were absorbed into PA, would PA become a safe blue state? And would DL become red? 

Etc etc 

(Conversely, we could ask if D.C. absorbed the entire DMV, would VA be red again, but I think a) the answer is obvious - yes it would) 

(I'm excluding NYC from this question because applying this to the tri state area basically removes CT and NJ from the map and very significant expands NY state's population, and I don't want to get bogged down with recalculating EC votes for this Q) ",Ask_Politics,0.2,2024-08-09,much mid-sized metro areas spilling state lines impact elections?

I am looking to get answers to a question of mine, thank you very much in advance, it is sincerely respected & appreciated my friends. 

I came here as I was looking for help answering a question regarding running for a political office. I've done research online, but most online sources tend not to touch on the subject in the depth I'm searching for, so decided to ask here for assistance. From what I've read reservists & members of the national guard are able to freely run for & serve in both federal, state, & local office in the various branches of government as long as they are not active at the time, which makes sense. Information on the subject seems to be pretty well defined in military & government regulations, as well as online resources. Active duty seems to have less information on the topic. I've found that servicemen can't run or serve in federal or state office within any branch for the most part. Though I have read about some exceptions that exist for a civil office with the explicit permission given by your specific service's secretary. I've found that these exceptions mostly occurs at the local level of government & it has be done in a way that isn't portraying yourself or the policies of your platform as representative of that service branch or the DOD. 

Above was a basic summary of what I've been able to find regarding my question which is helpful, but I have a question regarding the exceptions as those have been more difficult to find out about the various exceptions. What local positions in government would someone serving in an active duty role be able to run & serve. If there are any exceptions in the state & federal government those would be quite useful too. The specific branch of government doesn't matter to me, I would be interested to learn about any.

It always seems like it’s ok for Trump to say things that don’t make sense and no one brings up his mental status or worry about his physical ability or the possibility of age related changes but a lot of ageism was occurring towards the other side long before the debate…

Are there any actual Trump supporters concerned about his age and mental and physical well being when considering he will be 82 by the end and has shown his own mental and occasional physical issues…?

This article by Dan T. Coenen, UGA School of Law, argues that the 22nd and 12th Amendments would not prevent a former two-term president from serving as VP and then serving as President.  He also argues that there would not be a restriction on his term that would limit him to only two years, but only serving two years would be less legally perilous AND it would allow Biden to still run at the top of the ticket and continue to serve for an additional two years.

Why is the White House so soft on India.  I mean they have blatantly not only continued to trade with Russia but also increased imports of oil since the very beginning of the conflict.  Yet Biden has only seemed to get cozier and cozier with Modhi.  I also read the joint statement from India and US by the White House.  Needless to say it is a bit concerning.

1dzjobw,Is this socialism?,2024-07-09 21:38:59,1,3,"Background: I live in a very small town in Illinois. Let's get this detail taken care of first, it's a long hard drive to get to Chicago. The town is organized as a ""city"" and that's how I will refer to it going forward. Also, the trash company I will be referring to operates out of a neighboring county. 

The city government subcontracts with the trash company who provides curbside weekly pickup with provided containers. The charge for this ""service"" is on an entity's/resident's water bill. The line item is 17.50/month. Additionally, the city requested the trash service provide 8 large dumpsters on city owned property, and offered to allow county residents deposit their trash in these extra dumpsters for 17.50/month. 

Unfortunately the dumpsters where placed in a highly visible location on city property amongst downtown businesses and residences. There is no access card system set up and no fence. It is unsightly, incredibly messy, invites animals, and generally abused. There is no way to prove the abuse, since there are no access cards however it must be assumed, since, you know, human nature....

City Council meetings have been spicy! fiery! The most exciting thing around! The City Clerk (elected, non-partisan position) is adamant that the dumpsters stay where they are. He also claims that the dumpsters ""make"" the city 50,000/year. However, after 3 fun meetings, it's up to 65,000.

Make? Bad choice of words?

Is it governments job to ""make"" - which I understand as generating a profit, money? 

There is no question the city should be covering administrative costs, to include, direct and indirect costs that the city accrues. But he is now claiming this money covers his salary, the water clerk/treasurers salary, and a maintenance persons salary. ( Don't do the math, it's pretty ovbious, Do all three of them get food stamps you ask....?)

Let's get into the meat of this issue. Government's job is to set up and maintain basic services to keep society functioning in a healthy, safe, pleasant, even beautiful environmnet. The better educated, the more opportunities, the happier, calmer, little societal unrest, capitolism is profitably conducted when the greater good has been provided for first. But, is it the governments responsibility to create income (revenue-expenses=income) for itself. 

What next, a toilet paper company? Can government subcontract out with kimberly clark and put it on your water bill and deliver toilet paper on a weekly basis. Isn't that socialism or something?

This came up recently close to home, where in our national South African elections, small & newer parties threatened [legal action](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zumas-mk-party-seeks-stop-south-african-parliaments-first-sitting-after-election-2024-06-11/) & potential [violence](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2024-07-04-mk-party-members-fined-r150000-each-for-election-threats/) due to claims of 'rigging' and 'stolen votes', even when external auditors & general South Africans appeared to back the process and counts.

It feels like these (potentially unsubstantiated) claims are pushed with confidence, and I don't fully understand whether this is something orchestrated, or a simple echo chamber mimicking successful campaigns like those we saw in the US with Donald Trump?

1dxsunx,What makes Kamala Harris so often derided and does that derision extend past political observers?,2024-07-07 18:27:39,20,22,"In the many discussions around Biden stepping down and potential replacements there comes Harris, and she is routinely touted as non-viable. Even outside of that particular discussion Harris seems to have always been held in low regard in both liberal and conservative camps since she came to prominence in the 2020 primaries.

Is it a particular failing of mine that I don't really understand why this is the case, or is it only people who regularly pay attention to politics that think this, and most of the electorate knows almost nothing about Harris one way or another?

  
A quick search found a few articles in the New Yorker and Atlantic, but those are paywalled, so I was left with what seems to be the kindest interpretation of Harris I've ever seen invoked: [https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/06/10/why-they-hate-kamala-harris/](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/06/10/why-they-hate-kamala-harris/) and another that seems more even-keeled and views her as simply a politician getting crap for handling problems so they backfire on her instead of Biden: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60061473](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60061473)

These don't seem like the kind of thing the greater electorate cares about though, true of many political issues to be sure, but so far it seems more like a feedback loop of dislike that no one bothered to interrupt rather than any major failings on Harris' part?

Didn't find anything crazy in a quick review of her Wikipedia article, not a source of truth, but if there were something egregious I would expect some mention of it.

The rhetoric I keep hearing is that Biden simply comes off as too weak, cognitively and from a policy standpoint, to beat Trump. I also feel that right wing media has successfully sold the claim that inflation is entirely Biden’s fault, and that some financially struggling and/or overwhelmed Americans have fallaciously concluded that their finances will return to pre covid levels if Trump is in office again. I also feel like RFK will split the democratic voter base enough to hand Trump the election. The only reason RFK is getting attention is because compared to Trump and Biden, he looks like an angel. I truly don’t think he’d split otherwise blue voters as much as he is if we had a serious and capabele Democratic candidate.

There is the potential for pre-election litigation in some states that would make the process difficult and perhaps unsuccessful.

Their reason for doing this is to fracture the vote, so that in some states people will literally be unable to vote for the replacement candidate. Given the 2020 election this would make it impossible for Democrats to win.

He said even if a President dies the last day of his term and the VP is sworn in as President, that person cannot serve 2 terms of their own because it would exceed the 8 year limit. I don't know if the wording of that Amendment references years, days or even minutes. As a teenager, I thought that was incredibly unfair for a VP who hoped to serve as President some day. Being a bit (okay a lot) older now, I'm not satisfied with that answer from a high school teacher in the suburban Midwest. It also makes me wonder about a 'lame duck' Presidency. 

If a sitting President wins re-election and then dies before he/she is sworn in for their second term, does the VP (who I assume would be immediately sworn in) also get sworn in as President for what would have been the dead President's second term? That circles back to my first question. In this scenario, would the VP who succeeded under those circumstances be barred from seeking re-election due to term limits? 

It's a head scratcher because, to my knowledge, no sitting President has died between re-election and the start of the second term. Certainly not since current term-limit laws were exacted. 

I'd also be interested to know whether these answers are any different in the case of resignation (e.g. a President unable to continue due to a medical diagnosis. In the TV show The West Wing, POTUS had MS, if his condition deteriorated enough he would not have been able to finish his term).

Even though the salary of the restaurant staff is low and the cost of the food itself is not that high, then sandwich still has to be expensive for the restaurant to be able to stay afloat and pay all their bills, which I assume most of it is rent, building repairs, and sales tax (more than 10-15% in Canada at restaurants)

  
If someone made the same sandwich out of their basement, they could offer it for much less.

Other then the neighbors complaining about customers coming in and out (another real-estate issue), it seems like a fool-proof solution to high food prices to me.

1dkmv3r,Looking for career advice in an election year,2024-06-20 17:21:37,1,1,"So I (24F) am in the final interview stage for 2 different Democratic jobs, both of which I would consider a dream job. I know it’s FAR from a guarantee that I will get offered either job, let alone both, however, I want to be prepared in case I do get offered both because I will likely have a very short window of time to decide if I do get an offer.  

Job A is at a national political organization and would end Nov 15. It would be a great opportunity to develop professional connections more nationally and would give me a wider range of skills in my chosen field. I had the final interview yesterday and they just asked for my references. 

Job B is with one of the few members of Congress whose platform aligns with my values almost completely and it’s exactly the type of job I would be looking for if this weren’t an election year. From what I’ve seen, it’s rare to find a hill opening for a rep that shares your values, and even rarer to find a position with them that’s exactly the type of job you want to do. I would also have more job security here because it doesn’t end after the election in November (the rep is in a VERY safe blue seat). I know that the hill will be there after the election, but this job, and others like it, likely won’t be/there will be a lot more competition after everyone working the election gets laid off. I interviewed with them on Monday and they said they’d be in contact with me “shortly” and that they’re “looking to finalize everything by the start of July.”

Questions: 
1. Would I be missing out by not taking a campaign job? (I did organizing work on a campaign in 2020 so I’m not totally without campaign experience)

1dfsydz,"New Rules, a Clarification and Community Input",2024-06-14 11:02:50,4,8,"Good morning and a happy Friday to all (or apologies if its no longer Friday)!  We wanted to take a moment to talk about a few changes we are making, but also asking for community input on a few other things.

First, an update for rule 2 - the ""Good Faith"" rule.  We've added to this that all submissions *must* adhere to proper capitalization, punctuation and grammar.

What does this mean? Posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1dfgehh/whats_up_with_people_saying_acab/) will no longer be allowed (sorry to call you out).  In the future, all posts must follow the common rules of English writing.  no more writing like this i mean please no more god no more.  It should be ""No more writing like this, I mean please no more, god no more.""  Capitalize, attempt to use proper grammar and punctuation.  This doesn't mean we're going to become grammar nazi's, but give it that good ol' college try.

Next, a clarification for rule #3 - what does ""fact based"" mean?  Ideally, it means a source for whatever you claim, especially facts in dispute, even more if that's the origin of the question.  Further, remember that if you are asked for a source, *you need to provide one*.  Ideally *every* answer should include at least one source, if not more or *many* more.  For example, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1dewkku/the_aca_was_rolled_out_on_a_state_by_state_basis/l8kaoiv/) recent answer was very good and actually referenced something - ideally you'd toss in a link to the case at least.  This isn't meant, though, that you need to provide sources for common political knowledge - you don't need to cite that there are 435 members of Congress or that the President can sign executive orders or executive agreements.  But for the former, perhaps in your argument you need to cite the law that capped the representatives at 435.

Finally, two ideas we wanted to run by the community.

1. During the SCOTUS terms, especially when decisions are expected, should we have an ongoing megathread?  Many of these cases turn political very quickly (such as the bump-ban decision this morning) and often times we see a big influx.  However, megathreads can devolve into insanity at times, so there is a trade off.

2.  At what level of repeated questions should we use as a deciding factor to create a megathread?  We usually try to stay ahead of questions by watching headlines and such, but even we can get it wrong or it could be a subject that is a ground swell.

If you have any other suggestions, feel free to post them here and you're always welcome to messages the mods.

They're suing based on the overbroad [use of INA § Section 212(f)](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/understanding-ina-section-212f-president-authority-suspend-entry-migrants) which is said to violate INA § 208 which is:

>Any alien who is present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not in a designated port of arrival […]) irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum

But isn't the issue that anyone who arrives is claiming asylum and given the backlog of [2 million (as of when this was written in April)](https://hias.org/news/asylum-backlog-presents-anguish-uncertainty-seekers/) , they're basically free to live in the United States until their claim could be reviewed?

I don’t live in China, know any Chinese people, or am well-versed in what actually occurs over there, but from my understanding, China is essentially a one-party state with no other political competition. They are heavily involved with the economy, and have political members on the board of every company. 

The upside of this is that they are able to be highly efficient. Rather than being bogged down by endless debates, political polarization, the constant handing off of power, they are able to make decisions and act very rapidly in the face of changing environments. 

Hypothetically, if a one-party government were ethical, just, utilitarian, etc… wouldn’t this be the ideal system to run, akin to Plato’s philosopher king?

1d7vc87,How big a factor is the large size of the Baby Boomer generational cohort in leading to the issues facing a lot of western democracies today?,2024-06-04 07:58:09,12,17,"Obviously it's a simplification to try lump every western democracy in the same basket but, speaking in broad strokes, many countries are facing issues with expensive housing (with few new projects being built, due to the vested interests of existing property owners), lack of infrastructure investment, NIMBY, etc.


This is coupled with the Baby Boomer generation, itself the most numerous of the 20th century generational cohorts, moving into older age (where people are generally settled with the wealth they've made), which is also the demographic most likely to engage with/in politics (e.g. by voting).



To that end, has the West seen a sort of political dominance by a generational cohort that is able to wield largely unchallenged influence in politics? And is this something that has a precedent? Have there been other eras in democracies where a population explosion led to a generation that was empowered to quite blatantly pursue its own interests at the expense of other cohorts?



I suppose my question is an attempt to put politics/ideologies aside and simplify the current misbalance of how society seems set up to cater to people and explain it as a case of naked generational self-interest that has been enabled by the sheer overwhelming number (and according influence) of one particular cohort.",Ask_Politics,0.07142857142857142,2024-06-04,big factor large size baby boomer generational cohort leading issues facing lot western democracies today?

I may not be informed to how the Swiss people see themselves and their backgrounds so please educate me if that's the case.

The reason I'm asking is that I'm trying to formulate an analogy between the Swiss people and the Cypriot people. From my understanding, the Swiss have German, Italian and French (perhaps more?) ancestry but in their heart they feel Swiss first.

This is not the case in Cyprus where a lot of people feel Greek or Turkish first instead of Cypriot. This has the effect of even further dividing and categorising the island that how it currently is with even more subtle divisions like using Modern Greek as the official language, even though Cypriot Greek is spoken and is much different than Modern Greek. 

To keep it brief, the Cypriot people may be able to relate and understand themselves more by looking how other nations embraced their background but they still feel united as a nation.

1d2tzrs,"Subreddit Revamp, Pt 2",2024-05-28 16:42:25,2,0,"I wanted to add a bit more to some changes that you'll most likely notice as we continue.

The first and largest change is that any post older than six months will be archived as we've been seeing some weird, short responses on some *old* posts (one that was seven years old!) that added nothing.  We felt like six months is plenty of time to discuss an issue or question (especially as things continue to wind through legislatures).  And if something does pop up after that, you can always ask new question and link back to old ones (if you remember they're there!).

Second, we're going to add back megathreads but this time attempt to be a bit forward-looking for them.  For example, we'll be launching one related to the Trump case here shortly since that would draw questions.
